<p>first of all the plan appeared to have actually been opened when it arrived. so then I open the cameras and whatever appeared OKAY till I began to install the cameras outside of my home and discovered one one the cameras don't work and they do not be available in color. Also I needed to download the user's manual cause one isn't. supplied. The wires are super thin too. The cameras are OK for the rate I think. A great deal of the Nest Web Cam IQ Outdoor (and any other Nest Webcam's) best features are behind a paywall of sorts.</p>

<p>We discovered the Circle 2 isn't quite as good as the Nest Webcam for outdoor usage. It has a 10-foot power cord that restricts positioning, and it isn't weatherproof (you can add a weatherproof cord, however doing so makes each system cost more than a single Nest). Also, if you do not decide to use HomeKit Secure Video you'll need to sign up for a $10 monthly Circle Safe subscription to have recording storage and advanced features, such as notifications that distinguish between individuals and basic motion. We believe that's pricey.</p>
