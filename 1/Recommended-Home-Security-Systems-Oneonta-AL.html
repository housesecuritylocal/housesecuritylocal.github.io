Video surveillance monitoring is as old as the very idea of camera surveillance. Video surveillance has actually come a long method, spanning a number of decades. The first video surveillance system was a Closed-Circuit Tv (CCTV) set up in 1942 by German scientists to monitor the launch of rockets. The innovation gradually developed into the extremely advanced yet economical systems readily available today. The first usages of CCTV cameras required monitoring the feed in real-time - i.e., they did not have the methods to record video and enjoy it later on. Although video surveillance was monitored out of need in the early days, nowadays it is a deliberate practice to enhance the result of security systems.</p>

<p>Some wireless systems are vulnerable to electro-magnetic or structural disturbance. Radio frequencies walk around solid things; they can not go through them. So placing sensing units in the proper areas is essential if you desire them to work properly.
