To start, it helps to document what you require secured. For instance, in an apartment you may need one door sensor and one window sensor. In a large house, you may need two door sensing units, 8 window sensing units, a garage door sensing unit, cameras, motion detectors, and more.

Systems based around an NVR are much easier to scale up than DVR systems, simply since they can accept a new camera once it is contributed to the network. In the worst case, all that would be needed is an additional PoE switch. Some IP cameras are also wireless and can send video footage to the NVR over Wi-Fi. There are no distance restrictions so long as a camera is linked to the same network as the NVR. The largest disadvantage to an NVR system, nevertheless, is that not every IP camera will deal with every NVR. So you'll require to understand whether your cameras will work with a provided video recorder prior to buying.</p>
