<p>The Arlo Pro 3 is not terrific however good-- and so it isn't worth paying twice the rate of its predecessor. When the two are compared side by side, the Arlo Pro 3 does edge out the Pro 2 on battery life and image, with 2K HDR video that is sharper during day and nighttime viewing. However, color night vision image quality is frustrating, and the motion tracking function is a bit wonky. Also, the Pro 3 uses no complimentary storage, and external storage can't be seen through the app, just via a computer system. We will keep monitoring the Arlo Pro 3, however for now, we still believe the Arlo Pro 2 is a much better buy. Both are still better than the expensive Arlo Ultra, which we discovered to have horrible night-vision efficiency, poor battery life, and a propensity to miss out on far too many motion activates.</p>
<p>Like any intrusive technology, the advantages of deploying public camera must be stabilized against the expenses and dangers. This technology (a) has the potential modification the core experience of going out in public in America because of its chilling effect on residents, (b) carries extremely genuine risks of abuse and "mission creep," and (c) would not substantially secure us versus terrorism.
