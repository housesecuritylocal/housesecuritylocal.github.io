<p>Power-over-Ethernet changes apply only to NVR systems, but they cut out other elements that would be needed for a DVR system, like extra source of power and the BNC cables utilized to connect cameras to the DVR. Instead, when you link a PoE switch to your network, you have actually got a power source and a way of transmitting data to your NVR all in one plan. When picking which type of PoE switch to buy is the number of cameras that will be on your system, the biggest consideration. The next consideration is how most likely you are to scale up in the future.</p>
