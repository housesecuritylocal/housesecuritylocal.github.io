It deals with a wire or without, with a Canary Smart base station or without, and can operate indoors or inside - you get a great deal of versatility from this little gadget.

<p>We didn't think about alarm systems that needed professional installation. Pro-installed systems generally cost more, usage equipment similar to that of Do It Yourself systems, come with typically burdensome and long contracts, and typically count on the very same monitoring companies that self-installed systems utilize, so they offer little benefit.
