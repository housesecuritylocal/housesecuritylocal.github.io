<p>The problem with the small, set LED IR cameras is the plastic utilized in front of the lens and in some cases, the actual lens. After a couple of years in the harsher environments, this plastic tends to fade and end up being milky. This makes it challenging for the CCD or CMOS sensor to effectively translate the images, and if there's a series of LED IR lights surrounding the lens, it can cause a halo-like affect that blurs the image day and night. Indoors, these devices have a far longer life expectancy, however outdoors, or even in a garage without climate control, a lot of them lose their sharpness and clearness catching the severe environment.</p>

We have actually been very happy with the system, the people who represent the company and the security in which it gives our stores.

Keeping video is likewise a concern. Video files are large, which suggests a lot of area is required.

For longer access to video, anticipate to pay a month-to-month storage charge.</p>
