<p>Camera compatibility: Not every video recorder can deal with every camera. Obviously, DVRs need analog cameras, while NVRs use IP cameras, however the compatibility concern extends well beyond that distinction. Some NVR systems, for example, work with the IP cameras only from specific makers and not others. When buying a video recorder, you need to first ensure that the gadget will work with the cameras you have actually purchased. If you're dealing with a surveillance system integrator to configure your system, the cameras should have the ability to supply you with the essential details.</p>
<p>The NVR eliminates these issues, due to the fact that it is rather linked directly to a network. IP cameras that are connected to the same network, usually by way of a PoE switch, are then able to send video to the NVR. Systems based around an NVR are much easier to scale up than DVR systems, merely since they can accept a new camera once it is contributed to the network. In the worst case, all that would be needed is an additional PoE switch. Some IP cameras are likewise wireless and can transfer video footage to the NVR over Wi-Fi. There are no distance restrictions so long as a camera is connected to the very same network as the NVR. The largest drawback to an NVR system, however, is that not every IP camera will work with every NVR. So you'll need to understand whether your cameras will be compatible with a given video recorder before purchasing.</p>
