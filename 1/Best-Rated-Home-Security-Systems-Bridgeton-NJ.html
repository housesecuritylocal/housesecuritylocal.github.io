<p>The rest of the field is more specialized, dealing with sophisticated smart home connoisseurs or fans of a particular ecosytem of products. Nest's Secure has the very best style of any system I checked, including clever things like integrating a motion and the keypad detector into the base station and integrating motion detectors and entry sensors into one unit. But the Secure is expensive, additional sensing units are costly, and the monitoring service-- which doesn't include smoke alarm or camera backups-- is likewise costly if you do not dedicate to a three-year agreement.</p>
<p>Logitech includes 24 hours of cloud video storage with the Circle 2, and you can contribute to that with a Circle Safe membership plan. This membership service stores 14 days of clips from one camera for $4 each month-- making it cheaper and longer than Nest's subscription-- or 31 days for $10. The 31-day Premium plan also includes a variety of extra benefits, consisting of person detection and the option to focus the camera's attention on a specific area in the room.</p>
