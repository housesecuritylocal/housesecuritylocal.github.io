That stated, we actually liked Brinks' uncomplicated bundle options. You'll have three options to pick from, which vary from basic intrusion protection to full-on intrusion protection + home automation + video surveillance. We really enjoyed using Brinks' video functions, and we like how their top-tier package comes with an HD video doorbell for good step.</p>
