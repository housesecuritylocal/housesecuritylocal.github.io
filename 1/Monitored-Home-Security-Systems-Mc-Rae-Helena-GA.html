<p>No calls from a monitoring company: A self-monitored system avoids speaking to somebody from the monitoring company when an alarm is triggered. Let's face it, incorrect alarms are relatively common. If a property owner forgets their secrets and returns within with the alarm engaged, or an outdoor motion sensing unit is set off by a neighborhood cat, it can trigger the alarm. With an expertly monitored system, the house owner will be gotten in touch with by the monitoring company every time the alarm goes off, unless the property owner disables it quickly. False alarms happen. With a self-monitored system, a house owner will not get calls from a monitoring company. Instead, house owners access the alarm themselves and take the needed action.</p>
