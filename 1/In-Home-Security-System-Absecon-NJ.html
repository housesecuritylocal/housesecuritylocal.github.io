<p>I simply ended up upgrading all of my stock annke cameras with this model. The crucial difference with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal adjustment which allows you to modify the field of vision 1000% better than a camera without a horizontal modification. No clue why more bullet cameras do not have this really essential feature. Also great metal building and construction. Needed to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get right mode not in white and black. Had to make the wire hole a little bigger to fit the big choice gadget into the wall. Must be a better way to implement that. However it was just a little notch so not a deal breaker. Great resolution - far better field of vision vs the stock annke cameras and better clarity during the night. Ideally these hold up throughout the years! Highly suggest.</p>
