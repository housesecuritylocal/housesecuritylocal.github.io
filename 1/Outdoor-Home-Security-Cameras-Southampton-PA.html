<p>I just completed updating all of my stock annke cameras with this design. The key distinction with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal change which permits you to modify the field of vision 1000% much better than a camera without a horizontal adjustment. No clue why more bullet cameras do not have this really crucial feature. Likewise good metal construction. Had to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the delegated get right mode not in black and white. Had to make the wire hole a little larger to fit the big selection gadget into the wall. Must be a much better method to carry out that. However it was simply a little notch so not a deal breaker. Very good resolution - far better field of vision vs the stock annke cameras and better clearness at night. Hopefully these hold up over the years! Extremely recommend.</p>
