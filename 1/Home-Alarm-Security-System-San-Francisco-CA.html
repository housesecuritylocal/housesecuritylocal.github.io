<p>The Arlo Pro 3 is not terrific however good-- and so it isn't worth paying two times the cost of its predecessor. When the 2 are compared side by side, the Arlo Pro 3 does edge out the Pro 2 on battery life and image, with 2K HDR video that is sharper throughout day and nighttime viewing. Nevertheless, color night vision image quality is frustrating, and the motion tracking function is a bit wonky. Also, the Pro 3 provides no complimentary storage, and external storage can't be seen through the app, only via a computer. We will keep monitoring the Arlo Pro 3, but for now, we still think the Arlo Pro 2 is a better buy. Both are still much better than the expensive Arlo Ultra, which we found to have dreadful night-vision performance, poor battery life, and a tendency to miss out on far too many motion activates.</p>
<p>The motion detection is top notch, and the app is an enjoyment to use as well (a lot better than the apps you get with some spending plan security cameras), though if you wish to get into its cleverest customisations, there is a bit of a learning curve. For all the more basic smarts, it's terrific, though. If you do not currently have an Arlo camera or more in place, you're going to need to install a center that's wired to your router, so bear that in mind - the cameras all connect to the center (not to your Wi-Fi), and this can imply there are variety issues.</p>
