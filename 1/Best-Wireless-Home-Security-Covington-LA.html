<p>I simply completed upgrading all of my stock annke cameras with this model. The key distinction with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal modification which enables you to modify the field of view 1000% better than a camera without a horizontal change.

Need to be a better method to execute that. However it was simply a little notch so not a deal breaker.
