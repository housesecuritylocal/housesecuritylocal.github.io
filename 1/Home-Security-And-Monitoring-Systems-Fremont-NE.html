Yale is associated with home security and the yellow siren boxes are a big turn-off for prospective trespassers. In the past you 'd need deep pockets to have a Yale system professionally set up (and after that monitored for an additional cost) but the Smart Living variety is Do It Yourself, wireless and app-controlled.</p>

Several other models were disqualified due to performance problems. We had issues with the app for the Honeywell Home C2, which was likewise plagued with fuzzy night vision and left spaces (5 seconds to 10 seconds) in between 30-second clips.

<p>The only genuine concern we have is with the cost. The package isn't at all cheap in the first location, but if you wish to store 4K recordings in the cloud you'll need a higher-tier extra subscription. Nevertheless, it's tough to argue that the Arlo Ultra doesn't earn its cost - it's simply that it's very much a niche item due to the fact that of that price, when the Arlo Pro 3 has the exact same smarts for less.
