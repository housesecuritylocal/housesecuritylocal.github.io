<p>The Wyze Web cam v2 is the Cinderella story of security cameras. Formerly, we didn't consider it to be an effective security option (although we liked it as an animal web cam ).

We value that the company continues to iterate and enhance a product that costs about as much as a pizza. However, the video quality isn't quite as good as on our other choices, it has a restricted field of vision, and Wyze says it plans to do away with person detection, a minimum of momentarily (more on that in a minute).</p>
<p>The NVR gets rid of these problems, since it is instead linked directly to a network. IP cameras that are connected to the same network, normally by method of a PoE switch, are then able to transfer video to the NVR. Systems based around an NVR are much easier to scale up than DVR systems, merely due to the fact that they can accept a new camera once it is added to the network. In the worst case, all that would be needed is an extra PoE switch. Some IP cameras are also wireless and can transmit footage to the NVR over Wi-Fi. There are no proximity restrictions so long as a camera is linked to the exact same network as the NVR. The biggest downside to an NVR system, however, is that not every IP camera will work with every NVR. So you'll need to understand whether your cameras will work with an offered video recorder prior to buying.</p>
