<h3>Outdoor Surveillance Camera Corbin KY 40701</h3>
<p>A taut wire perimeter security system is generally an independent screen of tensioned tripwires usually installed on a fence or wall. Additionally, the screen can be made so thick that there is no requirement for a supporting chainwire fence. These systems are designed to identify any physical attempt to penetrate the barrier. Tight wire systems can run with a variety of switches or detectors that notice motion at each end of the tense wires. These switches or detectors can be an easy mechanical contact, static force transducer or an electronic stress gauge. Undesirable alarms caused by birds and other animals can be avoided by changing the sensing units to disregard items that apply small amounts of pressure on the wires. This kind of system is vulnerable to burglars digging under the fence. A concrete footing straight below the fence is set up to prevent this type of attack.</p>
