<h2>Is Wireless Camera Surveillance Equipment The Best Choice For Your Home Yorktown</h2>
<p>In a current New york city Times post about Chicago's 911 broadening digital video surveillance system, Albert Alschuler, a law teacher at Northwestern University, makes the point that public camera systems do not breach any personal privacy issues because they are set up in public places.

While the rate of break-ins nationally has reduced, the average loss has increased-- in 2018, that number was close to $3,0002 (more on that in the break-in statistics section above).</p>
