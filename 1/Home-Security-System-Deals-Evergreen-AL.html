Nest's Secure has the best style of any system I evaluated, including clever things like integrating the keypad and a motion detector into the base station and combining motion detectors and entry sensing units into one system. But the Secure is expensive, additional sensing units are pricey, and the monitoring service-- which does not include emergency alarm or camera backups-- is likewise costly if you do not devote to a three-year agreement.</p>
