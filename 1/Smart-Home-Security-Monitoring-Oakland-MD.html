<p>I simply finished updating all of my stock annke cameras with this design. The key difference with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal change which permits you to fine-tune the field of vision 1000% much better than a camera without a horizontal change. No idea why more bullet cameras do not have this extremely essential feature. Also good metal construction. Needed to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get appropriate mode not in black and white. Needed to make the wire hole a little larger to fit the substantial selection device into the wall. Need to be a much better way to implement that. However it was simply a little notch so not a deal breaker. Very good resolution - far better field of vision vs the stock annke cameras and far better clearness during the night. Ideally these hold up throughout the years! Highly suggest.</p>
