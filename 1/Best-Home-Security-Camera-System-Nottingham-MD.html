Nevertheless, neither model has geofencing, and the KC120 left gaps of approximately 25 seconds in between recordings. The Area can record approximately 3 minutes without spaces in between clips, but entries were frequently missing, in spite of showing up in the app's activity timeline. With basic clever home devices like automatic door locks, you can remain in bed and check that you locked your doors. And a video doorbell lets you watch out for potential bundle burglars or speak to visitors who visit.</p>
