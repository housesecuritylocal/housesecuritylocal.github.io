<p>Home security systems and modern clever home abilities and compatibilities allow you to tap into their sensors and cameras directly from your phone. For some, that might be worth the $300 cost. But while we like the clever functions and home automation compatibility of the Nest Web cam IQ, a lot of the cameras we looked at offer the very same perks at a more sensible cost.

<p>The Canary is one of the largest cameras we evaluated, and it provides two-way communication with its paid Canary Subscription. The rate of the Canary View makes the size a bit more palatable, but the image isn't as sharp, and recording wasn't constant throughout our testing. The Netatmo Welcome doesn't have two-way audio or digital zoom, and it continuously asked us to acknowledge already-identified faces. And regardless of having an attractive cost and good performance, the Yi 1080p Home Camera has complicated cloud storage that includes $65 to $150 each year to the cost of an otherwise budget camera.</p>
