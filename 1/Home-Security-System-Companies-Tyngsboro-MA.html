<h3>Best Monitored Home Security System in Massachusetts</h3>
<p>Good photo and I like that the cameras are white, they don't stand apart too much. Pretty simple to install. I also like that I can download the app in my android phone and see my cameras from away from your home. The 2nd important thing to state is that the Arlo Pro 2 has a remarkably shrill inbuilt alarm, so it operates as a home alarm in addition to a security camera. That differentiates it from the products I've already written, and assists in part to explain its price.</p>
<p>Motion sensing units use backup protection in case a burglar manages to get into your home. However they just operate when you're out of the house. Don't believe they'll safeguard you if somebody gets in when you're sleeping! Quite the opposite, your alarm really ignores motion sensor signals if you equip the system but stay home. If the system worked any other way, it would false alarm each time you walked into a protected room.</p>

<p>The Arlo Pro 3 is good however not excellent-- and so it isn't worth paying twice the price of its predecessor. When the 2 are compared side by side, the Arlo Pro 3 does edge out the Pro 2 on battery life and image, with 2K HDR video that is sharper during day and nighttime watching. Nevertheless, color night vision image quality is frustrating, and the motion tracking feature is a bit wonky. Likewise, the Pro 3 offers no totally free storage, and external storage can't be seen through the app, just via a computer system. We will keep monitoring the Arlo Pro 3, but for now, we still think the Arlo Pro 2 is a much better buy. Both are still better than the pricey Arlo Ultra, which we discovered to have awful night-vision performance, bad battery life, and a tendency to miss out on far too many motion sets off.</p>
