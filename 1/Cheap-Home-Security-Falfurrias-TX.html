<p>Wired: Each camera is connected to a recording unit, which in turn is linked to a router. Installation can be complicated - particularly if your home has currently been constructed - so make certain to consult with a professional before taking on the job yourself. Wired home security cameras send out information through a closed circuit, not over a signal. They're also not prone to disturbance such as cellular and radio frequencies. If you have a big home or residential or commercial property that needs detailed coverage, wired systems are a much better choice because they can support more cameras.</p>
