<p>I" m not pleased with this item. It needs an addition disk drive for storage and a cd disk to program in order to record. The picture quality is good. The motion sensors work well. I would not recommend it though. People who are tech-savvy or pushed for time might choose to install their own systems to prevent scheduling appointments and requiring time off from work. Calling in a professional costs more, however for those who choose to let a professional manage the job and don't mind investing the additional money, professional installation is the way to go.</p>
