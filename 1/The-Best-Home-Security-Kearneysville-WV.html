<p>Wireless security cameras being checked in a Customer Reports laboratory. If you do experience a home intrusion emergency, you can set off the 80dB alarm. I am a little dissatisfied by the volume of the alarm. At 80dB, it has to do with as loud as a food mill whereas numerous other alarm systems are as loud as 90dB or perhaps 105dB.

So, you will need to change and recharge the batteries, but the system won't tie you to your home.</p>
