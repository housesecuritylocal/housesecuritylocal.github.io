<p>Megapixel Cameras Now Available. Buying a wireless security system for your home is going to be a financial investment at first. Some systems also offer or need a professional monitoring service for an extra regular monthly charge. They may make a time-limited deal, and claim that you need to act now. For example, they may attempt to get you to sign an agreement by informing you that the equipment is "totally free." More than likely, strings are connected. For example, to get your "totally free" alarm, you may have to sign a pricey and long-term system monitoring contract.</p>
<p>Are you under an existing alarm monitoring agreement? Beware since many agreements have car renewal provisions that might lock you in for another 3 to 5 years at high pricing. Also its common to have a 30 or 60 day termination notice period. Exist any hidden termination fees they failed to discuss? Local dealerships and even nationwide dealerships such as ADT make a LOT of money on alarm monitoring contracts so they will make it as difficult as possible for their consumers to switch.</p>
