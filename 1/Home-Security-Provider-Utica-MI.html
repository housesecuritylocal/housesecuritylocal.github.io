Basically, wireless security systems rely on cellular signals to work - while wired systems work utilizing radio frequency. With wireless security, your cameras, sensors, lights and other security equipment are all connected to one base station or panel to receive sensors required to control your equipment consisting of enabling, disabling and sending you instant informs.
