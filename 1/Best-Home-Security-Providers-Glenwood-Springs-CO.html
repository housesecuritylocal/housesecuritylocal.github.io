<p>I simply completed upgrading all of my stock annke cameras with this model. The crucial distinction with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal adjustment which allows you to fine-tune the field of view 1000% better than a camera without a horizontal change. No clue why more bullet cameras do not have this very important function. Also good metal building. Had to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get appropriate mode not in black and white. Needed to make the wire hole a little bigger to fit the big choice device into the wall. Need to be a much better method to carry out that. However it was simply a little notch so not a deal breaker. Excellent resolution - better field of vision vs the stock annke cameras and far better clearness at night. Hopefully these hold up throughout the years! Highly advise.</p>
