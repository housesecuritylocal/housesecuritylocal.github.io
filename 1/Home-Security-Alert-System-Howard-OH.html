Alternatively, the screen can be made so thick that there is no requirement for a supporting chainwire fence. These systems are developed to detect any physical attempt to permeate the barrier. Tight wire systems can operate with a range of switches or detectors that notice motion at each end of the tense wires. These detectors or switches can be a basic mechanical contact, static force transducer or an electronic strain gauge. Undesirable alarms brought on by birds and other animals can be prevented by changing the sensing units to disregard items that put in small amounts of pressure on the wires. This kind of system is vulnerable to burglars digging under the fence. A concrete footing straight below the fence is installed to avoid this type of attack.</p>
