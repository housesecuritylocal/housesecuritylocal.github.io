<p>Frequently a wired system can be puzzled with local alarms. However, the 2 are drastically different.

It can be managed from another location through voice commands and you have access to each part of the wired system from your mobile device or through the control board (also known as the alarm panel). A local system does not have the capacity to couple with other clever devices and can not be controlled from another location. Also a local alarm won't get in touch with the authorities; it merely triggers an audible siren to signal people nearby.</p>
