<p>I simply completed updating all of my stock annke cameras with this design. The essential distinction with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal modification which allows you to tweak the field of view 1000% much better than a camera without a horizontal modification. No idea why more bullet cameras do not have this very essential feature. Likewise great metal construction. Had to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get correct mode not in black and white. Needed to make the wire hole a little bigger to fit the substantial selection gadget into the wall. Should be a much better way to execute that. But it was simply a little notch so not an offer breaker.
