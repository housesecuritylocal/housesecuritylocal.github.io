<p>We didn't consider alarm systems that required professional installation. Pro-installed systems typically cost more, use equipment similar to that of Do It Yourself systems, featured long and normally burdensome contracts, and typically rely on the very same monitoring companies that self-installed systems utilize, so they use little advantage. A good example is the Vivint system, which we've reviewed individually and do not suggest for many people.</p>
<p>A wireless home security system utilizes a radio frequency to communicate with the control board and sensing units. The control board then communicates with a monitoring center using a cellular signal. And, if you have a camera, the video recordings are sent to a receiver that's connected to your local or cloud storage.

<p>A tight wire perimeter security system is generally an independent screen of tensioned tripwires normally installed on a fence or wall. Additionally, the screen can be made so thick that there is no need for a supporting chainwire fence. These systems are created to detect any physical effort to permeate the barrier.
