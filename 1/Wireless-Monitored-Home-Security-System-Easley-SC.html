Indoors, these gadgets have a far longer life span, but outdoors, or even in a garage without environment control, a lot of them lose their sharpness and clearness succumbing to the severe environment.</p>

<p>I simply finished upgrading all of my stock annke cameras with this model. The key difference with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal adjustment which permits you to modify the field of vision 1000% much better than a camera without a horizontal adjustment. No hint why more bullet cameras do not have this very crucial feature. Likewise great metal building. Had to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get proper mode not in white and black. Needed to make the wire hole a little bigger to fit the substantial selection gadget into the wall. Must be a much better method to carry out that. However it was just a little notch so not a deal breaker. Great resolution - much better field of vision vs the stock annke cameras and much better clarity during the night. Ideally these hold up for many years! Highly advise.</p>
