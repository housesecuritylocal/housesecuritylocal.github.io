<p>I just completed updating all of my stock annke cameras with this design. The crucial difference with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal modification which permits you to modify the field of view 1000% much better than a camera without a horizontal change. No clue why more bullet cameras do not have this very crucial feature. Likewise nice metal building. Had to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get right mode not in white and black. Had to make the wire hole a little bigger to fit the substantial selection gadget into the wall. Should be a better method to carry out that. But it was just a little notch so not a deal breaker. Excellent resolution - much better field of view vs the stock annke cameras and far better clarity at night. Hopefully these hold up throughout the years! Highly recommend.</p>

<p>The DoS attack in itself does little to expose organizational data to a malicious opponent, because the disturbance of the network prevents the circulation of data and in fact indirectly protects information by preventing it from being sent. The typical reason for carrying out a DoS attack is to observe the healing of the wireless network, throughout which all of the preliminary handshake codes are re-transmitted by all devices, supplying an opportunity for the harmful enemy to tape these codes and utilize numerous cracking tools to examine security weaknesses and exploit them to get unauthorized access to the system. This works best on weakly encrypted systems such as WEP, where there are a variety of tools available which can release a dictionary design attack of "perhaps accepted" security keys based upon the "model" security key caught throughout the network recovery.</p>
