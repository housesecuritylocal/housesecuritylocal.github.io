The very first alternative, which might be the most intricate, is to reverse-engineer each system (if the initial option provider is not available or reluctant to supply those details) and document the topology and how they can be integrated into the new DVS system. The other method is to replace and rip, carrying out a total upgrade to a new security system that currently has all the existing system requirements plus the capability to assemble them all.</p>

<p>We discovered the Circle 2 isn't quite as good as the Nest Camera for outdoor use. It has a 10-foot power cord that restricts positioning, and it isn't weatherproof (you can include a weatherproof cord, however doing so makes each system cost more than a single Nest). Likewise, if you do not choose to use HomeKit Secure Video you'll need to sign up for a $10 regular monthly Circle Safe subscription to have taping storage and advanced functions, such as notifications that distinguish between individuals and basic motion. We think that's expensive.</p>
