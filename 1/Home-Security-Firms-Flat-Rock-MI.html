<p>The NVR gets rid of these issues, since it is instead linked directly to a network. IP cameras that are linked to the very same network, normally by way of a PoE switch, are then able to transfer footage to the NVR. Systems based around an NVR are much easier to scale up than DVR systems, just because they can accept a new camera once it is added to the network. In the worst case, all that would be required is an additional PoE switch. Some IP cameras are also wireless and can transmit video to the NVR over Wi-Fi. There are no distance constraints so long as a camera is linked to the very same network as the NVR. The biggest disadvantage to an NVR system, however, is that not every IP camera will work with every NVR. So you'll need to understand whether your cameras will work with a given video recorder prior to buying.</p>
