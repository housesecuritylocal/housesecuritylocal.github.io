Outdoor security cameras can hinder wrongdoers and offer an early warning before somebody enters your home.

<p>I just finished upgrading all of my stock annke cameras with this design. The key difference with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal modification which allows you to modify the field of vision 1000% better than a camera without a horizontal modification. No hint why more bullet cameras do not have this really important feature. Likewise great metal building. Needed to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the delegated get right mode not in white and black. Had to make the wire hole a little bigger to fit the big choice gadget into the wall. Need to be a better way to implement that. But it was just a little notch so not a deal breaker. Excellent resolution - better field of vision vs the stock annke cameras and much better clearness at night. Ideally these hold up over the years! Extremely advise.</p>
