<h3>Wireless Home Security Alarm in Massachusetts</h3>
<p>Like the Nest Web Cam IQ Indoor, this model has Familiar Face notifies, which can identify people the camera is identifying utilizing face recognition. When it finds a person in the frame, it will ask whether you understand that person and if so to tag them by name.

We think this feature (which requires a Nest Aware subscription) is more beneficial outdoors, where you are more likely to wish to distinguish predicted visitors from random complete strangers. We likewise found the function to be more dependable on the IQ Outdoor than on the indoor IQ design (on the indoor design, this feature was always asking us to determine faces on a neighboring TV). 3 microphones (versus the Nest Camera Outdoor's one) also offer a broader variety of audio, so you can much better hear what's going on in recordings.</p>
