<p>In a current New york city Times article about Chicago's 911 broadening digital video surveillance system, Albert Alschuler, a law teacher at Northwestern University, makes the point that public camera systems do not break any personal privacy concerns because they are installed in public places. They have actually been carried out for public safety and crime prevention and are not for the exploitation of individuals.

You can set a video recorder to "overwrite" the earliest footage when you reach the system's capability, but if you're not mindful, the system might overwrite archived video that you still require.</p>
<p>Years earlier, all alarm required you to have a landline phone and that landline was used to connect your security system to the monitoring center and there weren't any other choices.
