If you're stressed over charging, Arlo offers a photovoltaic panel, which we have not tested. The Arlo's operating temperature variety is -4 degrees Fahrenheit to 113 degrees Fahrenheit. During screening, we had 2 Arlo Pro cameras established outside in temperatures that fluctuated between 30 degrees Fahrenheit and 80 degrees Fahrenheit. After one full month, the camera that saw less action was still running at 80 percent. The one pointed at a hectic street was standing strong at 60 percent. Throughout long-term testing, we put the camera in a business parking lot that saw a good amount of weekly traffic.

<p>We looked for DIY systems that used professional monitoring, both with and without a contract.
