<p>With modern burglar alarm systems from Security Instrument, you and your household will have the very best defense possible from burglaries and theft. Arlo Pro 2 also has an outstanding Night Vision function. It is geared up with infrared lenses that enable the camera to record videos even in complete darkness.

As such, even if somebody burglarize your home in total darkness, you'll still be able to see them in your mobile phone app. The only issue here is that the taped footage will be white and black and a little dark so you might not be able to see details plainly.</p>
<p>If you wish to playback your home's outdoor activity, you'll need a camera with onboard video storage or cloud recording abilities. Many cameras with recording abilities have a built-in secure digital (SD) or microSD slot that allows for adequate recording area.

Some popular cameras automatically override expired videos, which may not be most perfect if you need to keep a video. On the contrary, some security camera companies provide cloud storage month-to-month plans to safely save videos on the cloud. You can easily access them anytime, anywhere by signing into your account on your mobile device or utilizing a mobile app.</p>
