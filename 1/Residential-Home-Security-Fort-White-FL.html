<p>Home security systems and contemporary clever home abilities and compatibilities permit you to use their sensing units and cameras straight from your phone.

<p>The Nest Cam IQ includes a built-in Google Assistant and incorporates effortlessly with the remainder of the Nest home automation suite. It sticks out with an 8x digital zoom feature and big 130 Â° field of view. Video quality is likewise terrific, and this camera can shoot in (compressed) 4K.
