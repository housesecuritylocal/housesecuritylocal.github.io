<p>Home security systems and contemporary clever home abilities and compatibilities permit you to use their sensing units and cameras straight from your phone.

<p>The Nest Cam IQ includes a built-in Google Assistant and incorporates effortlessly with the remainder of the Nest home automation suite.
