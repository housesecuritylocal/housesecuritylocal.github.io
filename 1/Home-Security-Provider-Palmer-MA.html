<p>The NVR removes these problems, due to the fact that it is instead connected directly to a network.

In the worst case, all that would be required is an extra PoE switch. Some IP cameras are likewise wireless and can transmit video to the NVR over Wi-Fi. There are no distance restrictions so long as a camera is connected to the same network as the NVR. The largest disadvantage to an NVR system, however, is that not every IP camera will deal with every NVR. So you'll need to understand whether your cameras will be compatible with a given video recorder prior to buying.</p>
