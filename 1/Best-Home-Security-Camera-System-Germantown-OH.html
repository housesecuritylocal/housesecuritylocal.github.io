<p>Get best-in-class security, plus wise home automation the entire household will like. It's a neat trick, and one that works pretty well, but only when you have actually configured the rest of the settings. I've got a huge pet dog, so needed to specify the areas for the camera to detect i.e. at adult chest height near doors, not low down where the pet dog will be walking.

<p>I just finished upgrading all of my stock annke cameras with this model. The essential distinction with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal modification which allows you to fine-tune the field of view 1000% much better than a camera without a horizontal adjustment. No clue why more bullet cameras do not have this extremely crucial function. Also good metal building. Needed to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get correct mode not in black and white. Needed to make the wire hole a little bigger to fit the huge choice gadget into the wall. Should be a much better method to implement that. But it was just a little notch so not an offer breaker. Very good resolution - better field of view vs the stock annke cameras and much better clarity during the night. Ideally these hold up throughout the years! Highly advise.</p>
