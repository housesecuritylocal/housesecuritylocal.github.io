<p>The real reason cameras are normally deployed is to reduce much pettier crimes. But it has not even been shown that they can do that. In Britain, where cameras have actually been extensively released in public places, sociologists studying the problem have actually discovered that they have not lowered criminal activity. "Once the criminal activity and offense figures were adapted to appraise the basic down trend in criminal activities and offenses," criminologists found in one study, "reductions were noted in certain classifications but there was no evidence to recommend that the cameras had actually minimized criminal offense overall in the city centre."

<p>CCTV cameras are better at catching lawbreakers after they have actually devoted a criminal offense, instead of having the ability to stop a crime in development. Somebody has to be actively seeing the video screens for all 10,000 cameras if they are going to try to discover criminal activity before it occurs.
