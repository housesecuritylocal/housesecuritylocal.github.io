<p>I just finished updating all of my stock annke cameras with this design. The essential distinction with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal change which enables you to tweak the field of view 1000% better than a camera without a horizontal change. No idea why more bullet cameras do not have this very crucial function. Also good metal building and construction. Needed to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get correct mode not in white and black. Needed to make the wire hole a little bigger to fit the huge choice gadget into the wall. Need to be a better way to execute that. But it was just a little notch so not an offer breaker. Excellent resolution - much better field of view vs the stock annke cameras and better clarity at night. Hopefully these hold up over the years! Extremely suggest.</p>
