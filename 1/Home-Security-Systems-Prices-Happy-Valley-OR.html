Smart alarm systems changed that. Originally, conventional security systems were hardwired into the home and monitored by a central station, usually a home alarm company. The client paid regular monthly charges.</p>
<p>Outwardly there's no difference in between the 1080p design of the Swann Smart Security Camera and its 720p predecessor: both use the exact same compact housing, both utilize the exact same install - and that latter feature is a shame.
