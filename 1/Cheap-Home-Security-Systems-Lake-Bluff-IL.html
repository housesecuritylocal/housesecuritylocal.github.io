<p>A taut wire boundary security system is essentially an independent screen of tensioned tripwires normally installed on a fence or wall. Alternatively, the screen can be made so thick that there is no requirement for a supporting chainwire fence. These systems are developed to find any physical effort to penetrate the barrier. Taut wire systems can run with a range of switches or detectors that notice motion at each end of the tense wires. These switches or detectors can be a simple mechanical contact, static force transducer or an electronic pressure gauge. Undesirable alarms brought on by birds and other animals can be prevented by adjusting the sensing units to disregard items that put in small amounts of pressure on the wires.
