With wireless security, your cameras, sensors, lights and other security equipment are all connected to one base station or panel to receive sensing units needed to manage your equipment including enabling, disabling and sending you immediate informs. As soon as a signal is gotten, you'll get an alert from the security provider's mobile app, web, e-mail, or text portal.
