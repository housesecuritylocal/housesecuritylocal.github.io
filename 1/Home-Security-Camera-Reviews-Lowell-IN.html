Rather, you can filter event notifications only by high activity, days, or person (the latter is offered only with a paid Circle Safe subscription). Without a paid Circle Safe subscription, you'll get more signals, which you can only filter to get every minute, 15 minutes, or 30 minutes. When used in high-traffic areas, the subscription is more beneficial. Otherwise, the Smart Location feature can be set to disable recording when you're home-- to avoid alerts whenever you walk by. Oddly, though the app supports multiple users, its geofencing uses to each user individually, so if everybody in your family has the Circle app installed, you'll still get notifications when other individuals are home.</p>
