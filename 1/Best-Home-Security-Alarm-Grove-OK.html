<p>Had ADT, technically still have.  If you want to leave the agreement you have to pay 75% of the contract.  So I still have 21 months of an agreement I had no idea I was in, to go out I need to pay $783.  Actually frustrating. Once again the sales individuals, or a minimum of mine, do not mention the 3 year commitment. I called their client service group and they acknowledged that the sales individuals do not need to discuss it, it's on you to check out the fine print. I'm paying the lump sum, because apparently they vehicle renew you eventually unless you nail the timing.  There are reports of having to send out in a written not by mail.  ADT is a headache, method too costly, and not fantastic.</p>
<p>The $20 Wyze Webcam isn't simply a fantastic budget plan security camera, it's an excellent camera. Period.
