Wyze's recently released Complete Motion Capture resolves this issue for $1.50 each month per camera. It makes it possible for recording of all motion the camera senses, for as much as 5 minutes in a row. If motion continues beyond that window, the camera ends one clip and quickly begins another, without any gaps in between.
