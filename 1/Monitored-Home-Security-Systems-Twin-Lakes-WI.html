Throughout screening, we had two Arlo Pro cameras set up outside in temperature levels that fluctuated between 30 degrees Fahrenheit and 80 degrees Fahrenheit. After one complete month, the camera that saw less action was still performing at 80 percent. The one pointed at a hectic street was standing strong at 60 percent. During long-lasting testing, we put the camera in a business parking area that saw a good quantity of weekly traffic. This drained the camera to the point where it needed a full charge once a month.</p>
