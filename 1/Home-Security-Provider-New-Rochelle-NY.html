Wyze's just recently introduced Total Motion Capture solves this problem for $1.50 monthly per camera. It makes it possible for recording of all motion the camera senses, for as much as 5 minutes in a row. If motion continues beyond that window, the camera ends one clip and immediately begins another, with no gaps in between. Recordings are simple to discover under the Events tab at the bottom of the app. Without the membership, you still get the limited cloud recording and microSD recording, but we don't suggest that for home security since if it's taken, you don't have a backup.</p>

This creates a one in three chance of capturing a particular occurrence on video (either live or tape-recorded). The command center also included a computer system designated for submitting occurrence reports online. These can be accessed by management workers at a later date from a database through the computer network.</p>
