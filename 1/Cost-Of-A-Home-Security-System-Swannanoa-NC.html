<p>The cost of admission for the Deep Guard Home Security system isn't that steep, even at $499, because it includes 3 outdoor cameras with two-way audio. And the $50-per-month membership cost sounds pricey, however it's not so much when you think about that a live human being is viewing a live feed whenever the cameras detect suspicious activity. That person at Deep Guard's center can warn a suspicious individual that they're being observed, and they can call your local police dispatcher if they refuse to engage or leave in a criminal act.

<p>The rest of the field is more specialized, catering to innovative wise home enthusiasts or fans of a specific ecosytem of products. Nest's Secure has the very best design of any system I evaluated, consisting of clever things like incorporating a motion and the keypad detector into the base station and integrating motion detectors and entry sensing units into one system. However the Secure is costly, additional sensing units are expensive, and the monitoring service-- which doesn't include emergency alarm or camera backups-- is likewise costly if you don't devote to a three-year agreement.</p>
<p>Simply secure the wireless cameras in those crucial areas, supply power by plugging them into a nearby electrical socket, and the receivers (connected to the DVR) will pick up the signal.
