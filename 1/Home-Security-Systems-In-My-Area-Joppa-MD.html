<h3>Security Alarm Installation in Joppa MD</h3>
<p>This system uses an electro-magnetic field disruption concept based upon 2 unshielded (or 'dripping') coax cables buried roughly 30 cm (1 feet) deep and 1 m (10 ft) apart. 6 The transmitter gives off continuous Radio Frequency (RF) energy along one cable and the energy is gotten by the other cable.
