We appreciate that the company continues to repeat and enhance a product that costs about as much as a pizza. Nevertheless, the video quality isn't quite as good as on our other picks, it has a limited field of view, and Wyze states it plans to do away with person detection, at least momentarily (more on that in a minute).</p>
