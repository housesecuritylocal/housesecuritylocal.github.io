In many cases, Cat5e and Cat6 cable televisions will also power the security cameras, getting rid of the requirement for additional wiring. When the security cameras are not connected to an NVR, this is called Power-Over-Ethernet and needs a PoE switch. Wireless security cameras might need less electrical wiring in the walls but will still require cables to power the security camera independently, generally via 110VAC power.</p>
