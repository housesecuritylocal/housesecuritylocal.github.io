<p>I just finished updating all of my stock annke cameras with this model. The essential difference with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal adjustment which permits you to modify the field of vision 1000% much better than a camera without a horizontal change. No hint why more bullet cameras do not have this really important feature. Likewise great metal building and construction. Needed to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the delegated get correct mode not in white and black. Had to make the wire hole a little larger to fit the big selection gadget into the wall. Need to be a better way to carry out that. However it was just a little notch so not an offer breaker. Very good resolution - much better field of view vs the stock annke cameras and better clearness during the night. Ideally these hold up throughout the years! Highly suggest.</p>
