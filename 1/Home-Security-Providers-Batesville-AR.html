<p>While some components may be affected briefly by a power blackout, cellular and landline systems will continue to work even if there's no electrical energy. Cellular systems utilize cell towers to communicate with the monitoring center along with a battery backup that can keep them up and running for a number of hours until the electrical service is brought back. Landline systems use traditional phone lines to communicate with the monitoring center and, just like cellular systems, they generally have a battery backup to keep them working for a set amount of time.</p>
<p>The Arlo Pro 3 is good but not excellent-- and so it isn't worth paying twice the cost of its predecessor. When the 2 are compared side by side, the Arlo Pro 3 does edge out the Pro 2 on battery life and image, with 2K HDR video that is sharper throughout day and nighttime watching. However, color night vision image quality is frustrating, and the motion tracking feature is a bit wonky. Also, the Pro 3 offers no free storage, and external storage can't be viewed through the app, just through a computer system. We will keep monitoring the Arlo Pro 3, but for now, we still believe the Arlo Pro 2 is a better buy. Both are still better than the pricey Arlo Ultra, which we found to have dreadful night-vision efficiency, bad battery life, and a tendency to miss out on far a lot of motion activates.</p>
