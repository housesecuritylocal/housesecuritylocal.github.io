<p>CCTV surveillance is grounded in the criminology theory that suggests potential offenders are less most likely to commit crime if they believe they are being watched or have a higher threat of being captured. This is also called the rational choice theory (La Vigne et al. 2011). CCTV is likewise grounded in situational crime prevention method, which argues that chances to anger can be lowered by modifying a variety of systems such as increasing the threat of a culprit being apprehended, increasing the effort to commit the criminal activity, reducing benefits from crime commission, and decreasing provocations that generate criminal chances (La Vigne et al. 2011). This implies that the transgressor needs to know the included surveillance for it to accomplish its preferred result.</p>
<p>Power-over-Ethernet switches apply only to NVR systems, but they cut out other parts that would be necessary for a DVR system, like additional power sources and the BNC cables used to connect cameras to the DVR.

The greatest consideration when choosing which type of PoE switch to buy is the number of cameras that will be on your system. The next factor to consider is how most likely you are to scale up in the future.</p>
