<p>Arlo claims that you must have the ability to get four to six months out of a completely charged battery, depending upon settings, usage, and surrounding temperature. In long-lasting testing of the camera, we generally got half that, unless the camera was facing a low-traffic area. If you're worried about charging, Arlo offers a photovoltaic panel, which we have not tested. The Arlo's operating temperature level range is -4 degrees Fahrenheit to 113 degrees Fahrenheit. Throughout testing, we had two Arlo Pro cameras established outside in temperature levels that changed in between 30 degrees Fahrenheit and 80 degrees Fahrenheit. After one complete month, the camera that saw less action was still performing at 80 percent. The one pointed at a busy street was standing strong at 60 percent. During long-lasting screening, we put the camera in a business car park that saw a good quantity of weekly traffic. This drained the camera to the point where it required a full charge once a month.</p>
