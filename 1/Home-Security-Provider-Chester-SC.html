Wireless security systems are more integratable and nimble, however low signal strength and bad connectivity are still common grievances. Hardwired systems need very little maintenance, and except a general power blackout, are harder to interfere with. Regardless of a basic enhancement in wireless technology, there seem fewer ways for hardwired systems to be interfered with and disabled.</p>

<p>Although 360 ° and 720 ° cameras may have the exact same resolution spec as that of a basic IP camera, that resolution is being topped a much larger area and therefore provides fewer pixels per inch. Here is what this suggests, by way of an example. Presume 2 cameras, one a standard camera with a 130 ° field of view and the other a 720 ° camera, and both cameras are high-resolution 10MP (megapixel) designs. This suggests the 720 ° camera has far less resolution per square inch; it is beginning with the same image sensor, 10MP in this case, though it needs to spread out that image throughout a far larger area and therefore will not look as crisp of a camera that just has a 130 ° field of view.</p>
