Whilst these are reasonably discreet CCTV cameras in appearance, this doesn't stop them from preventing bad guys. Since the dome case makes it truly challenging for people to see which direction the camera is pointing, this is. This creates an air of unpredictability for possible burglars or vandals approaching from all directions. , if those situations sound like your life, Vivint and Link Interactive provide some flexibility on monitoring agreement length if you buy equipment up front..
