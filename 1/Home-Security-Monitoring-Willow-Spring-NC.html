Prior To the Arlo Ultra came and blew our minds, the Arlo Pro 2 was our security camera beloved. Even now, if you want to carry out a whole system of cameras that work well together, the Arlo Pro 2 is a good choice.

<p>The motion detection is excellent, and the app is a pleasure to utilize too (a lot much better than the apps you get with some budget plan security cameras), though if you want to enter into its cleverest customisations, there is a bit of a learning curve. For all the more basic smarts, it's terrific, though. If you do not currently have an Arlo camera or more in place, you're going to require to install a hub that's wired to your router, so bear that in mind - the cameras all connect to the center (not to your Wi-Fi), and this can imply there are variety problems.</p>
