<p>First and foremost, it's hard to hate the image coming out of this $20 camera. It's not as sharp as our other choices, however it's better than a great deal of cameras that are four times the rate. The field of view is a narrow 110 degrees (compared with 130 on Nest and Netgear and Logitech's 180). However, after nearly two years of use, day and night images have constantly been clear, and we never ever had issues with the camera missing out on motion, a problem we came across when evaluating the Wyze Camera Pan And for those times when you're left wondering why your camera sent a motion alert, Wyze has a smart feature you can toggle on or off called Motion Tagging It creates a green, on-screen box around the motion identified.

I Would certainly purchase from cctvsecuritypros once again. I highly recommend this company. The Nest Aware service is what makes this camera stand apart-- it's what offers the video history and smarter alerts, for example.
