<p>Six basic CCTV security camera technologies exist in todays CCTV surveillance markets.

<p>In the evening, though it lacks the complete IR LED range of some rivals, the Arlo catches enough light to see a good distance, and there's an adjustable spotlight available if you're putting it outdoors - which neatly brings us to the wonderful motion detection. Not just is the Arlo fast to pick out moving items, it's brainy enough to make a good stab at working out precisely what it's taking a look at. Just a couple years ago, the home security industry was controlled by a couple of huge names using expensive, stiff strategies with little flexibility and unfriendly, long-term contracts.
