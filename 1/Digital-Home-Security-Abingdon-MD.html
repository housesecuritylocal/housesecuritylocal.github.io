The following video presents the Bosch Security autodome IP camera line, just one of many lines of security cameras they provide.

<p>Like the Nest Cam IQ Indoor, this design has Familiar Face informs, which can recognize individuals the camera is finding using face acknowledgment. When it spots an individual in the frame, it will ask whether you understand that person and if so to tag them by name. After a while, the camera will discover to identify those individuals and will send smart device signals with that details when they appear at your home. We think this function (which needs a Nest Aware subscription) is more beneficial outdoors, where you are more likely to wish to identify expected visitors from random strangers. We also found the feature to be more dependable on the IQ Outdoor than on the indoor IQ design (on the indoor model, this function was constantly asking us to identify faces on a nearby TELEVISION). 3 microphones (versus the Nest Web cam Outdoor's one) likewise offer a broader range of audio, so you can much better hear what's going on in recordings.</p>

<p>We found the Circle 2 isn't rather as good as the Nest Webcam for outdoor use. It has a 10-foot power cable that restricts placement, and it isn't weatherproof (you can add a weatherproof cable, however doing so makes each system cost more than a single Nest). Likewise, if you do not choose to utilize HomeKit Secure Video you'll require to register for a $10 regular monthly Circle Safe membership to have tape-recording storage and advanced features, such as notices that compare individuals and general motion. We think that's expensive.</p>
