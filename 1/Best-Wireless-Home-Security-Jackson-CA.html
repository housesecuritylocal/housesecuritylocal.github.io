<p>Arlo declares that you ought to be able to get four to six months out of a completely charged battery, depending on settings, usage, and surrounding temperature level. In long-term screening of the camera, we usually got half that, unless the camera was facing a low-traffic location. If you're fretted about charging, Arlo sells a photovoltaic panel, which we have actually not evaluated. The Arlo's operating temperature range is -4 degrees Fahrenheit to 113 degrees Fahrenheit. During screening, we had two Arlo Pro cameras established outside in temperature levels that fluctuated in between 30 degrees Fahrenheit and 80 degrees Fahrenheit. After one complete month, the camera that saw less action was still running at 80 percent. The one pointed at a busy street was standing strong at 60 percent.
