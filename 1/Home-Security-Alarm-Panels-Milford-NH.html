<p>We deliver value-added security and surveillance systems and services offering convenience, assurance and satisfaction to every customer and are committed to satisfying our consumer's needs with stability, sincerity, interest and exceptional service. Among IP security options, there are wired, wireless, and wire-free cameras. Wireless cameras gather and send information over a wireless network. These security cameras link to a user's home wifi network and permits that user to see the video from anywhere. A common misunderstanding is that wireless implies the camera is wire-free. This is not the case as wireless cameras might still require a power cord. Wired security cameras are linked to a recorder directly which then links to the internet and a router. Lastly, wire-free cameras are totally cable complimentary and battery powered. Although battery replacements are required, these are the easiest alternative to install and all of the tape-recorded footage is kept in the cloud.</p>
<p>Surveillance cameras can be displayed freely or kept discreet. If displayed freely, specifically when accompanied by a warning sign, they can offer an active deterrent to criminal activity.

Wyze's just recently launched Total Motion Capture resolves this issue for $1.50 each month per camera. It enables recording of all motion the camera senses, for approximately 5 minutes in a row. If motion continues beyond that window, the camera ends one clip and quickly begins another, with no gaps in between. Recordings are easy to find under the Events tab at the bottom of the app. Without the subscription, you still get the limited cloud recording and microSD recording, but we do not advise that for home security because if it's taken, you do not have a backup.</p>
