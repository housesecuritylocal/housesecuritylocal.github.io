Among IP security options, there are wired, wireless, and wire-free cameras. Wireless cameras gather and send information over a wireless network. These security cameras link to a user's home wifi network and permits that user to see the video from anywhere. A common misunderstanding is that wireless implies the camera is wire-free. This is not the case as wireless cameras might still require a power cord. Wired security cameras are linked to a recorder directly which then links to the internet and a router. Lastly, wire-free cameras are totally cable complimentary and battery powered. Although battery replacements are required, these are the easiest alternative to install and all of the tape-recorded footage is kept in the cloud.</p>

Wyze's just recently launched Total Motion Capture resolves this issue for $1.50 each month per camera. It enables recording of all motion the camera senses, for approximately 5 minutes in a row. If motion continues beyond that window, the camera ends one clip and quickly begins another, with no gaps in between.
