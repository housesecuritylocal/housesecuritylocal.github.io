<p>Picking Vivint means you're getting the best in clever home innovation. And that consists of security cameras: 1080p HD pan, zoom and resolution functions, and wide-angle lenses that offer you a more total image.

<p>Having animals suggests you will need to consider their size, motions, and any other aspects that could cause issues. For instance, if you have animals that are over 30 pounds, you will need a security system whose motion sensing units can be changed or a system that can be installed in such a way that your big family pets will not cause incorrect alarms to be sent whenever your family pet relocations. If you have large animals, you may want to think about skipping the motion sensing units and rely more on the window and door sensors which aren't triggered by motion but are triggered when a window or door is opened.</p>
<p>I" m not satisfied with this item. It needs an addition hard disk for storage and a cd disk to program in order to record. The image quality is good. The motion sensing units work well. I wouldn't recommend it though. Individuals who are tech-savvy or pushed for time might choose to install their own systems to avoid scheduling consultations and taking some time off from work. Employing a professional costs more, but for those who choose to let a professional deal with the task and don't mind spending the additional money, professional installation is the method to go.</p>
