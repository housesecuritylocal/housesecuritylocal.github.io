<p>I simply finished updating all of my stock annke cameras with this design. The essential difference with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal modification which enables you to modify the field of view 1000% better than a camera without a horizontal adjustment. No hint why more bullet cameras do not have this extremely crucial feature. Likewise nice metal construction. Needed to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the delegated get right mode not in white and black. Had to make the wire hole a little larger to fit the big selection device into the wall. Should be a better way to carry out that. However it was simply a little notch so not a deal breaker. Great resolution - better field of vision vs the stock annke cameras and better clearness in the evening. Hopefully these hold up over the years! Highly advise.</p>
