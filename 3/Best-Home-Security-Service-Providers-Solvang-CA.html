<p>Arlo declares that you ought to have the ability to get 4 to six months out of a fully charged battery, depending on settings, use, and surrounding temperature level. In long-term screening of the camera, we normally got half that, unless the camera was dealing with a low-traffic location. If you're stressed over charging, Arlo sells a photovoltaic panel, which we have actually not tested. The Arlo's operating temperature level range is -4 degrees Fahrenheit to 113 degrees Fahrenheit. During testing, we had 2 Arlo Pro cameras set up outside in temperatures that varied in between 30 degrees Fahrenheit and 80 degrees Fahrenheit. After one full month, the camera that saw less action was still performing at 80 percent. The one pointed at a busy street was standing strong at 60 percent. During long-lasting testing, we put the camera in a business parking area that saw a good amount of weekly traffic.
