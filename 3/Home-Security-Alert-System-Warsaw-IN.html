The essential distinction with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal modification which enables you to tweak the field of vision 1000% much better than a camera without a horizontal modification. No hint why more bullet cameras do not have this really essential feature. Also good metal construction. Needed to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the delegated get right mode not in white and black. Needed to make the wire hole a little bigger to fit the huge selection gadget into the wall. Should be a better method to execute that. But it was just a little notch so not a deal breaker.
