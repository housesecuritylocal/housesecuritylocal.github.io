<p>While some elements might be affected for a little while by a power failure, cellular and landline systems will continue to work even if there's no electricity. Cellular systems utilize cell towers to interact with the monitoring center as well as a battery backup that can keep them up and running for a number of hours up until the electrical service is brought back.
