The combination of digital video surveillance and access control becomes part of the natural merging of security technologies. Centralizing security into a single interface uses extra details that may never ever have been possible in the past, such as notification of an employee, by name and recognition number, going into the structure. A picture of that staff member exists on screen for confirmation (verifying it's not a stolen ID), and, through image capture on the security camera, making sure no tailgating happens.</p>
<p>The issue with the small, set LED IR cameras is the plastic used in front of the lens and in some cases, the actual lens.

Indoors, these devices have a far longer life expectancy, but outdoors, or even in a garage without environment control, a number of them lose their sharpness and clarity catching the severe environment.</p>
