<p>Most importantly, it's tough to dislike the image coming out of this $20 camera. It's not as sharp as our other choices, however it's better than a lot of cameras that are four times the rate. The field of view is a narrow 110 degrees (compared with 130 on Nest and Netgear and Logitech's 180).

<p>We thought about just cameras that run over Wi-Fi without the requirement for a networked video recorder; we narrowed that note down based upon reviews, features, and cost. Ring Alarm is one of the good-looking security systems on the market. The design is a reflection of simplicity, and the style is tidy and sophisticated. The Ring items are resilient and light-weight, and the keypad digits have a more vintage feel when you press them. The small, black orb of a dome camera uses a better field of view than its bullet equivalent. It's likewise more subtle, more long lasting types of security cameras on the market.

<p>You'll need to purchase a Nest Aware subscription in order to conserve video footage. You can choose in between rolling 5, 10, and 30-day storage options, but you can't choose one rate to cover all cameras. Nest Aware subscriptions are priced per camera, and if you wish to opt out of spending for storage entirely, Nest only gives you up to 3 hours worth of recordings.

<p>Power-over-Ethernet changes use just to NVR systems, but they cut out other elements that would be needed for a DVR system, like additional power sources and the BNC cable televisions used to connect cameras to the DVR. Rather, when you connect a PoE switch to your network, you have actually got a power source and a means of sending information to your NVR all in one bundle. The most significant factor to consider when choosing which type of PoE switch to buy is the number of cameras that will be on your system. The next consideration is how most likely you are to scale up in the future.</p>
