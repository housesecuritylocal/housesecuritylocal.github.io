<p>first of all the bundle seemed to have actually been opened when it arrived. so then I open the cameras and whatever seemed OKAY till I started to install the cameras beyond my home and learnt one one the cameras don't work and they don't come in color. Also I had to download the instruction manual cause one isn't. provided. The wires are incredibly thin too. The cameras are OKAY for the rate I think.

<p>What is a thermal camera, and where might you want one? Here is a brief explanation of how thermal cameras work: All items emit infrared energy (heat) as a function of their temperature. The infrared energy discharged by a things is called its heat signature. In general, the hotter an item is, the more radiation it releases. A thermal camera includes a heat sensing unit that can finding tiny distinctions in temperature.

Some alarm are connected to video surveillance systems so that existing video of the intrusion area can be quickly displayed on a remote monitor, not to point out recorded.</p>
