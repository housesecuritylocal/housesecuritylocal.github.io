Even though it doesn't have the best operating temperature level range (-4 degrees Fahrenheit to 104 degrees Fahrenheit), the Nest is one of the few cameras on our list that featured a truly weatherproof cable and plug. That treatment makes the cord quite thick, so you can't actually run it through a window opening.</p>
<p>Last, we also consider just how much it costs to view, conserve and share taped video.
