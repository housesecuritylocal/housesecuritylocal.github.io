<p>I just ended up updating all of my stock annke cameras with this design. The essential distinction with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal modification which permits you to tweak the field of view 1000% better than a camera without a horizontal adjustment.

Had to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the delegated get right mode not in black and white. Needed to make the wire hole a little bigger to fit the big selection device into the wall. Must be a better way to carry out that. But it was simply a little notch so not a deal breaker. Very good resolution - better field of vision vs the stock annke cameras and far better clarity at night. Ideally these hold up throughout the years! Highly suggest.</p>
