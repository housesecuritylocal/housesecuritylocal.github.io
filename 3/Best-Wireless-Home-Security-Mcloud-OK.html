<p>The Arlo Pro 3 is good however not terrific-- and so it isn't worth paying two times the rate of its predecessor. When the two are compared side by side, the Arlo Pro 3 does edge out the Pro 2 on battery life and image, with 2K HDR video that is sharper during day and nighttime watching. However, color night vision image quality is frustrating, and the motion tracking function is a bit wonky. Also, the Pro 3 uses no free storage, and external storage can't be viewed through the app, just via a computer. We will keep monitoring the Arlo Pro 3, however for now, we still believe the Arlo Pro 2 is a much better buy. Both are still better than the expensive Arlo Ultra, which we discovered to have terrible night-vision efficiency, bad battery life, and a propensity to miss far a lot of motion sets off.</p>
