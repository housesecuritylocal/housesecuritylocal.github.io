<p>Arlo declares that you need to be able to get 4 to 6 months out of a fully charged battery, depending on settings, use, and surrounding temperature level. In long-lasting screening of the camera, we usually got half that, unless the camera was facing a low-traffic area. If you're fretted about charging, Arlo offers a solar panel, which we have actually not evaluated. The Arlo's operating temperature range is -4 degrees Fahrenheit to 113 degrees Fahrenheit. During testing, we had two Arlo Pro cameras set up outside in temperatures that varied in between 30 degrees Fahrenheit and 80 degrees Fahrenheit. After one complete month, the camera that saw less action was still performing at 80 percent. The one pointed at a hectic street was standing strong at 60 percent.
