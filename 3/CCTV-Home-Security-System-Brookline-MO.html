By combining LiveWatch Do It Yourself security systems with Moni's expert monitoring, we can see Brinks Home Security competing with other huge names in the industry. Throughout our hands-on testing of Brinks, we found the systems to be rather easy to establish and utilize-- but not quite as simple as brand names like SimpliSafe or Ring Alarm.</p>
