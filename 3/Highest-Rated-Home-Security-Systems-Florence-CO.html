<p>I just completed upgrading all of my stock annke cameras with this design. The key difference with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal adjustment which permits you to fine-tune the field of view 1000% better than a camera without a horizontal adjustment. No hint why more bullet cameras do not have this really essential feature. Likewise nice metal construction. Needed to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the delegated get appropriate mode not in white and black. Had to make the wire hole a little bigger to fit the huge choice gadget into the wall. Should be a much better method to carry out that. But it was simply a little notch so not a deal breaker. Very good resolution - far better field of view vs the stock annke cameras and better clearness at night. Hopefully these hold up over the years! Highly advise.</p>
