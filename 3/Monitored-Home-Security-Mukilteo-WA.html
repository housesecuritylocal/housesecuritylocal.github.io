<p>Like the Nest Webcam IQ Indoor, this design has Familiar Face alerts, which can determine people the camera is finding using face recognition. When it identifies a person in the frame, it will ask whether you understand that person and if so to tag them by name. After a while, the camera will learn to identify those people and will send out smartphone notifies with that info when they appear at your home. We think this function (which requires a Nest Aware membership) is more beneficial outdoors, where you are more likely to wish to distinguish predicted visitors from random complete strangers. We also found the function to be more reputable on the IQ Outdoor than on the indoor IQ design (on the indoor model, this feature was always asking us to recognize faces on a neighboring TV).

<p>Just purchased a bullet ip system and definitely enjoy it. Excellent clearness. I wished to establish viewing on my mobile phone but had a couple concerns that the tech addressed with ease. I Would absolutely buy from cctvsecuritypros again. I extremely suggest this company. The Nest Aware service is what makes this camera stick out-- it's what provides the video history and smarter alerts, for instance. However, those features come at a comparatively steep price: $5 each month ($50 annually) for the first camera for five days of video history, $10 monthly ($100 per year) for 10 days of video history, or $30 per month ($300 annually) for 30 days of video history.  For each extra camera, the subscription is discounted to about half of the preliminary fee. By contrast, Arlo charges $3 monthly for person detection with 30 days of cloud storage, and Logitech charges $10 for those functions and bumps storage as much as 31 days.</p>
<p>I" m not satisfied with this item. It needs an addition hard drive for storage and a cd disk to program in order to record. The picture quality is good. The motion sensors work well. I wouldn't advise it though. Individuals who are tech-savvy or pushed for time might prefer to install their own systems to avoid scheduling consultations and taking time off from work. Employing a service technician costs more, but for those who choose to let an expert manage the job and don't mind investing the additional money, expert installation is the method to go.</p>
<p>As with the Nest, if you add a paid subscription to this camera, it becomes a lot smarter (and, minus some subtle differences, the membership prepares put the Circle 2 on a par with the Nest in regards to functions). A membership also makes sure that you'll be covered if you go away for a couple of days. The Circle Safe Basic plan provides 2 week of video storage for $4 each month per camera (compared to $5 for five days for Nest Aware).
