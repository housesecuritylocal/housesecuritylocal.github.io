<p>We also like that Ring still has good clever home support. Some other cheap security systems, like SimpliSafe and Cove, do not work so well with smart home gadgets like lights and locks. Ring Alarm supports Z-Wave, so you can incorporate your clever outlets with your general security system. With the advances in technology, monitoring a home security system is fairly simple.
