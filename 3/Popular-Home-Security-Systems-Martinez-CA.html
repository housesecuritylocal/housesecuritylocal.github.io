<p>The Wyze Cam v2 is the Cinderella story of security cameras. Previously, we didn't consider it to be a powerful security alternative (although we enjoyed it as a pet cam ). It has actually considering that been enhanced and now rivals our top picks due to the addition of a new cloud service, two-factor authentication for security, and numerous smart-home combination choices. We value that the company continues to repeat and enhance a product that costs about as much as a pizza. However, the video quality isn't quite as good as on our other choices, it has a minimal field of vision, and Wyze states it prepares to do away with person detection, at least temporarily (more on that in a minute).</p>
