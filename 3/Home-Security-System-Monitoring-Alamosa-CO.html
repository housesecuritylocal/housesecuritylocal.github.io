When it identifies an individual in the frame, it will ask whether you understand that person and if so to tag them by name. After a while, the camera will learn to determine those individuals and will send out smartphone notifies with that details when they show up at your home.

We also found the function to be more dependable on the IQ Outdoor than on the indoor IQ design (on the indoor design, this function was constantly asking us to recognize faces on a close-by TELEVISION). Three microphones (versus the Nest Webcam Outdoor's one) also provide a wider variety of audio, so you can better hear what's going on in recordings.</p>
