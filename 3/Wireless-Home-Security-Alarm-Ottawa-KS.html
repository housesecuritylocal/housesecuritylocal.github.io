<p>I just ended up upgrading all of my stock annke cameras with this model. The essential difference with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal adjustment which allows you to fine-tune the field of vision 1000% better than a camera without a horizontal adjustment. No clue why more bullet cameras do not have this very crucial feature. Also great metal building. Needed to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get proper mode not in white and black. Had to make the wire hole a little larger to fit the huge choice device into the wall. Need to be a much better method to carry out that. But it was simply a little notch so not an offer breaker. Excellent resolution - much better field of vision vs the stock annke cameras and better clarity in the evening. Ideally these hold up throughout the years! Highly suggest.</p>
