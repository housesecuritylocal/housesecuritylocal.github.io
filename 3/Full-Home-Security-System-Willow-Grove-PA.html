The first uses of CCTV cameras required monitoring the feed in real-time - i.e., they did not have the ways to tape-record video and enjoy it later.

<p>The Wyze Webcam v2 is the Cinderella story of security cameras. Formerly, we didn't consider it to be a powerful security choice (although we liked it as an animal cam ). It has because been enhanced and now matches our top picks due to the addition of a new cloud service, two-factor authentication for security, and numerous smart-home combination choices. We value that the company continues to iterate and enhance an item that costs about as much as a pizza. However, the video quality isn't quite as good as on our other picks, it has a limited field of vision, and Wyze says it prepares to do away with individual detection, a minimum of momentarily (more on that in a minute).</p>

<p>Lighting: Many security cameras are able to shoot in what is referred to as "low-light infrared," allowing them to capture clear video in dark conditions. These cameras depend on infrared LED lights, which cover the dark area in infrared light. Unlike human beings, the camera is able to see this infrared light, so when those wavelengths show back, it's as if the camera is shooting video footage in a brightened room. The more IR LEDs that a camera has, the much better it has the ability to see during the night. If capturing footage in the dark is a priority, make sure your camera has a lot of IR LEDs.</p>
<p>Unlike a lot of other cameras we tested, the corded Circle 2 does not have sensitivity settings for motion detection (though the cordless design does ). Rather, you can filter occasion alerts just by high activity, days, or person (the latter is offered only with a paid Circle Safe membership). Without a paid Circle Safe membership, you'll get more notifies, which you can just filter to get every minute, 15 minutes, or 30 minutes. When used in high-traffic locations, the subscription is more useful. Otherwise, the Smart Place feature can be set to disable recording when you're home-- to avoid informs every time you stroll by. Strangely, though the app supports multiple users, its geofencing uses to each user separately, so if everyone in your household has the Circle app set up, you'll still get notifications when other people are home.</p>
