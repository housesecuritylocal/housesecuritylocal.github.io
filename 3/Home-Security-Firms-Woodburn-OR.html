They utilize infrared night vision, have adjustable settings, and live stream to the Frontpoint app. To get the most out of the camera, place it where it's most visible. Its wireless installation provides you a lot of versatility. If the camera is battery powered you can place it basically anywhere without any wires, recharging the battery and getting rid of when it runs low, which is generally prompted through its app. Obviously the advantage is that these can be put anywhere very quickly, but the downside is that if it's simple for you to remove the camera to alter the battery, it'll probably be simple for intruders to remove it too.</p>
