<h3>Best Monitored Home Security System in Michigan</h3>
<p>The Nest Cam Outdoor's 1080p images and sound were outstanding in our testing-- throughout the day and in the evening-- with a wide, 130-degree field of view and 8 x digital zoom that allowed us to get a closer view in live video. We should keep in mind that the camera would sometimes downgrade the image quality based upon offered bandwidth, which could vary throughout the day. Nest consists of the option to set the bandwidth to low, medium, and high, but that may beat the purpose of having a 1080p camera.</p>
