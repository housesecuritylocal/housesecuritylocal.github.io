<p>Seattle's main intent with this law is to hold alarm-monitoring companies more accountable for false alarms, and minimize the number of unneeded cops and fire responses.

<p>The motion detection is excellent, and the app is a satisfaction to utilize too (a lot better than the apps you get with some budget plan security cameras), though if you want to enter into its cleverest customisations, there is a little bit of a knowing curve. For all the more basic smarts, it's excellent, though. If you do not already have an Arlo camera or two in location, you're going to need to install a hub that's wired to your router, so bear that in mind - the cameras all connect to the hub (not to your Wi-Fi), and this can indicate there are range issues.</p>
