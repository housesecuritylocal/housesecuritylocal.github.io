<p>I simply ended up updating all of my stock annke cameras with this model. The key distinction with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal adjustment which allows you to fine-tune the field of view 1000% better than a camera without a horizontal change. No idea why more bullet cameras do not have this really important feature. Also good metal building and construction. Had to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get correct mode not in black and white. Had to make the wire hole a little bigger to fit the huge choice device into the wall. Need to be a much better method to carry out that. However it was just a little notch so not a deal breaker. Great resolution - better field of view vs the stock annke cameras and much better clearness during the night. Hopefully these hold up throughout the years! Extremely advise.</p>
