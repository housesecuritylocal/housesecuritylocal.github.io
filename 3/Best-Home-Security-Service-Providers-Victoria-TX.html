<p>Local storage: Some cameras include memory-card slots in lieu of, or in addition to, cloud storage, so you can keep video right on the gadget.

<p>We discovered the Circle 2 isn't rather as good as the Nest Camera for outdoor use. It has a 10-foot power cable that restricts positioning, and it isn't weatherproof (you can add a weatherproof cord, however doing so makes each system cost more than a single Nest). Also, if you do not opt to use HomeKit Secure Video you'll need to sign up for a $10 regular monthly Circle Safe membership to have tape-recording storage and advanced features, such as notices that distinguish between people and general motion. We believe that's pricey.</p>
