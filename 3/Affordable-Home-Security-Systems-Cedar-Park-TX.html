A narrow or large  visual field is among the first questions a user ought to think about. Monitored systems count on experts to look for triggered alarms, contact system owners, and dispatch emergency services. Unmonitored security systems aren't linked to a monitoring center.

Nest's Secure has the very best design of any system I evaluated, including clever things like integrating a motion and the keypad detector into the base station and combining motion detectors and entry sensors into one unit.
