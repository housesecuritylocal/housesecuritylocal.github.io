<h3>Home Wireless Security in Camden SC</h3>
<p>This system employs an electro-magnetic field disturbance concept based upon two unshielded (or 'leaking') coax cables buried approximately 30 cm (1 ft) deep and 1 m (10 feet) apart. 6 The transmitter gives off constant Radio Frequency (RF) energy along one cable television and the energy is received by the other cable.

<p>Not all security cameras operate in the dark. Security cameras that have low-light capabilities have a shutter that allows more light to go into the camera's sensing unit.
