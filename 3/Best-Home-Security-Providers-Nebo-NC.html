<p>We tried to find DIY systems that offered professional monitoring, both with and without an agreement.

Some individuals might want to sign up for service only for when they or their partner runs out town, for example. No-contract systems also cost less in the long run and enable you to be in overall control of the equipment you use, along with how and when you use and pay for monitoring services.</p>
