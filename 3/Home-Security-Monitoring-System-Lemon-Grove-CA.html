Must be a better way to carry out that. But it was just a little notch so not an offer breaker.

<p>The Arlo Pro 2 is a user friendly outdoor Wi-Fi camera that's compact and can be used hardwired or entirely wirelessly-- the latter thanks to a removable, rechargeable battery that, based on our screening, must provide a minimum of a couple of months of operation on a charge (depending on use). The Arlo Pro 2 is also the only cord-free 1080p camera on our list that uses 7 days of free cloud storage (with more readily available for a monthly cost ).
