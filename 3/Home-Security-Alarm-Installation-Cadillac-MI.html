<p>I simply ended up updating all of my stock annke cameras with this design. The crucial distinction with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal change which allows you to modify the field of view 1000% better than a camera without a horizontal adjustment. No clue why more bullet cameras do not have this extremely important feature. Likewise great metal building and construction. Needed to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the delegated get correct mode not in black and white. Had to make the wire hole a little larger to fit the substantial choice device into the wall. Must be a much better method to carry out that. However it was simply a little notch so not an offer breaker.
