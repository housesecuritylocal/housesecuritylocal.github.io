<p>Lighting: Many security cameras have the ability to shoot in what is called "low-light infrared," enabling them to record clear video in dark conditions. These cameras rely on infrared LED lights, which cover the dark area in infrared light. Unlike people, the camera is able to see this infrared light, so when those wavelengths reflect back, it's as if the camera is shooting video in a lit up room.
