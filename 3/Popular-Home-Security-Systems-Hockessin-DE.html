SimpliSafe is not great at clever home support. It works with Amazon Alexa, and it uses its own smart door lock, but you can't go setting up numerous third-party devices with your SimpliSafe system. It does not work with Z-Wave or IFTTT, and we do not anticipate it to add extra performance anytime soon.</p>

<p>Twenty-five years ago, general and business interactions were mostly concurrent.
