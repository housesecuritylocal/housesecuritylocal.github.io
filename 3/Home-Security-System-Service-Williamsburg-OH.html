<p>A societal agreement about how cameras must be used is essential, but in the end we are a country of laws and rights that have their root in law. While the Fourth Amendment to the US Constitution provides some protection versus video searches carried out by the police, there are currently no general, legally enforceable rules to limit privacy invasions and secure versus abuse of CCTV systems. Guidelines are needed to establish a clear public understanding of such issues as whether video signals are taped, under what conditions, and for how long are they maintained; what the criteria are for access to archived video by other federal government agencies, or by the public; how the rules would be verified and enforced; and what penalties would use to violators.</p>

<p>Nurse calling systems usually include emergency situation buttons or pull strings within the client's washroom.

The majority of your commercial security cameras consist of dry contact input ports to integrate alarms and alerts, sensing units, access control, and so on. My mind conceived an approach of not only providing the client with the patient-monitoring system but integrating it into their old nurse call station system.</p>

Get alerts when your cameras find motion.
