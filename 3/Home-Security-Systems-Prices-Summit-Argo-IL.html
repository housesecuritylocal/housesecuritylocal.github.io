<p>Camera compatibility: Not every video recorder can work with every camera. Of course, DVRs need analog cameras, while NVRs utilize IP cameras, but the compatibility question extends well beyond that distinction. Some NVR systems, for example, are compatible with the IP cameras only from specific makers and not others. When purchasing a video recorder, you must initially make sure that the gadget will work with the cameras you've purchased. The cameras need to be able to supply you with the needed info if you're working with a surveillance system integrator to configure your system.</p>
<p>The NVR eliminates these problems, because it is instead connected directly to a network. IP cameras that are linked to the same network, generally by method of a PoE switch, are then able to transfer video to the NVR. Systems based around an NVR are a lot easier to scale up than DVR systems, just since they can accept a new camera once it is contributed to the network. In the worst case, all that would be required is an extra PoE switch. Some IP cameras are likewise wireless and can transfer video to the NVR over Wi-Fi. There are no proximity limitations so long as a camera is linked to the same network as the NVR. The biggest downside to an NVR system, however, is that not every IP camera will deal with every NVR. So you'll require to know whether your cameras will be compatible with a given video recorder prior to purchasing.</p>
