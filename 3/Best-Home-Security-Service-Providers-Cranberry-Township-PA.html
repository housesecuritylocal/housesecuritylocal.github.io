<p>If an alarm goes off when you're away, this house Beginner Set will just let you know that there's an emergency.

Is it a false alarm? Has the entry sensor merely been tripped by an animal or animal? Or do you have something to fret about?

Wyze's just recently released Complete Motion Capture resolves this issue for $1.50 each month per camera. It enables recording of all motion the camera senses, for approximately five minutes in a row. If motion continues beyond that window, the camera ends one clip and quickly starts another, with no spaces in between. Recordings are easy to find under the Occasions tab at the bottom of the app. Without the subscription, you still get the limited cloud recording and microSD recording, but we don't recommend that for home security due to the fact that if it's taken, you don't have a backup.</p>
