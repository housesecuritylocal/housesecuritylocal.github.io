When a patient pushes the emergency situation button, it sends dual alerts: one to the nurse calling station and the other to the main patient-monitoring command center, through the VMS.

<p>The Arlo Pro 2 is a user friendly outdoor Wi-Fi camera that's compact and can be used hardwired or totally wirelessly-- the latter thanks to a detachable, rechargeable battery that, based on our screening, must provide a minimum of a number of months of operation on a charge (depending upon usage). The Arlo Pro 2 is likewise the only cord-free 1080p camera on our list that offers seven days of free cloud storage (with more offered for a monthly fee ).

If home security is your primary concern, we 'd recommend among our top picks, but the Arlo is excellent for checking in on family and animals-- or stray felines sliding around your yard.</p>
