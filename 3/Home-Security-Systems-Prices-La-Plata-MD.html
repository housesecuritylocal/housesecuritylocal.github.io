In addition, if the main patient-monitoring command center got a motion detection alarm, indicating that a high-risk patient left her bed, the patient-monitoring operator would assess the danger and, if required, might merely press an onscreen button to call the nursing station on that specific flooring.</p>
<p>Commercial-grade cameras solve this problem with an unique light-handling feature. These cameras use both a software application and hardware option called HDR, which stand for High Dynamic Variety". In our example here, HDR takes an exposure of the room and an exposure of the entrance and after that integrates the two images together to create a properly-exposed composite image of the two locations. As far as anybody is concerned, the image looks completely regular given that the doorway and space seem at the very same brightness level. As a result, faces are appropriately exposed at the door and in the store, accomplishing the objective of recording video of everybody getting in the store. HDR is now a standard function in commercial cameras. Sadly, once consumers understand that the inexpensive consumer camera they purchased is lacking HDR, it's typically far too late because the recorders and cameras are set up.</p>

<p>We searched for DIY systems that provided professional monitoring, both with and without a contract. Although some companies supply free or heavily discounted hardware in exchange for a service commitment that can last anywhere from one to five years, we found no-contract systems to be the most versatile.
