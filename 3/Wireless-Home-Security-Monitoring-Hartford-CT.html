The key distinction with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal adjustment which allows you to tweak the field of view 1000% much better than a camera without a horizontal adjustment. No hint why more bullet cameras do not have this really essential function. Also good metal building. Had to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get right mode not in black and white. Needed to make the wire hole a little larger to fit the big choice device into the wall. Should be a better way to execute that. However it was simply a little notch so not an offer breaker. Very good resolution - far better field of vision vs the stock annke cameras and much better clearness in the evening. Ideally these hold up for many years! Extremely advise.</p>
