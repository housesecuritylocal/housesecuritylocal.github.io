<p>When using IP cameras - as most CCTV systems do these days - you will more than likely be taking a look at Cat5E or Cat6 cables, which can move the big amount of data required by digital video and high resolutions at very quick speeds, and often over fars away. This is an upgrade from the coax cabling that typically powers analog security cameras; coax cables are reliable, however not suitable with IP cameras. In a lot of cases, Cat5e and Cat6 cable televisions will also power the security cameras, removing the need for more electrical wiring. This is called Power-Over-Ethernet and requires a PoE switch when the security cameras are not linked to an NVR. Wireless security cameras may require less circuitry in the walls but will still require cables to power the security camera individually, usually through 110VAC power.</p>

Nevertheless, Frontpoint's plans are somewhat more pricey for the very same level of service, its contracts are longer, its cancellation fees are onerous, and its pricing is less transparent than that of the Brinks system, which we no longer advise anyhow.</p>
