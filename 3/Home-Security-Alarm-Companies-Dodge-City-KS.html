The key difference with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal change which enables you to tweak the field of vision 1000% much better than a camera without a horizontal modification.

Needed to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get appropriate mode not in black and white. Had to make the wire hole a little larger to fit the huge selection gadget into the wall. Need to be a better method to execute that. However it was just a little notch so not a deal breaker.
