<p>The rest of the field is more specialized, catering to sophisticated smart home enthusiasts or fans of a specific ecosytem of products. Nest's Secure has the best design of any system I checked, consisting of creative things like incorporating a motion and the keypad detector into the base station and integrating motion detectors and entry sensing units into one system. But the Secure is costly, extra sensors are pricey, and the monitoring service-- which does not consist of fire alarms or camera backups-- is also expensive if you don't devote to a three-year agreement.</p>
<p>The motion detection is excellent, and the app is a pleasure to utilize too (a lot much better than the apps you get with some budget plan security cameras), though if you wish to get into its cleverest customisations, there is a little a learning curve. For even more basic smarts, it's terrific, though.
