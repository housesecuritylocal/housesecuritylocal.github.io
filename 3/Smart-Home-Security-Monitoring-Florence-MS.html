<p>A tight wire boundary security system is basically an independent screen of tensioned tripwires generally installed on a fence or wall. Alternatively, the screen can be made so thick that there is no requirement for a supporting chainwire fence. These systems are developed to detect any physical attempt to permeate the barrier. Tight wire systems can operate with a variety of switches or detectors that sense movement at each end of the tense wires.
