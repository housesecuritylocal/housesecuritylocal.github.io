The handsome shiny black cube, magnetically affixed to a brushed metal stand (mine came in a lovely rose-gold however you can also get it in silver) strikes the ideal balance in between attractive and subtle adequate to not draw attention to itself.

<p>I have this camera hooked up to my home computer as part of my home surveillance system. With the long USB cord, I was able location the camera around 10 feet away from my desk aiming into my corridor. The security program I utilize is "blue iris" which was able to find the camera without difficulty. The IR lights in the evening have the ability to throw light a good 20 feet in a tight circle.

We think that's pricey.</p>
