<h3>Security House System Kiln MS 39556</h3>
<p>A tight wire boundary security system is generally an independent screen of tensioned tripwires normally installed on a fence or wall. Additionally, the screen can be made so thick that there is no need for a supporting chainwire fence. These systems are created to detect any physical effort to penetrate the barrier. Taut wire systems can run with a variety of switches or detectors that sense motion at each end of the tense wires. These detectors or switches can be a simple mechanical contact, static force transducer or an electronic pressure gauge. Unwanted alarms caused by birds and other animals can be prevented by changing the sensing units to ignore things that exert small amounts of pressure on the wires.
