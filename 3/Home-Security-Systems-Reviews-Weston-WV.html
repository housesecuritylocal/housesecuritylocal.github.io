<p>The NVR eliminates these issues, since it is instead linked straight to a network. IP cameras that are linked to the exact same network, usually by way of a PoE switch, are then able to send video footage to the NVR.

In the worst case, all that would be required is an extra PoE switch. Some IP cameras are likewise wireless and can transfer footage to the NVR over Wi-Fi. There are no distance limitations so long as a camera is linked to the same network as the NVR. The largest downside to an NVR system, nevertheless, is that not every IP camera will deal with every NVR. So you'll need to know whether your cameras will be compatible with a provided video recorder prior to purchasing.</p>
