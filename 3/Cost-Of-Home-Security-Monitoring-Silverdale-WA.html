<h3>Top Home Alarm Systems Silverdale WA 98383</h3>
<p>A taut wire border security system is basically an independent screen of tensioned tripwires usually installed on a fence or wall. Alternatively, the screen can be made so thick that there is no need for a supporting chainwire fence. These systems are created to spot any physical effort to permeate the barrier. Taut wire systems can operate with a variety of switches or detectors that pick up motion at each end of the tense wires. These switches or detectors can be an easy mechanical contact, fixed force transducer or an electronic pressure gauge. Undesirable alarms caused by birds and other animals can be prevented by adjusting the sensors to neglect objects that put in percentages of pressure on the wires.
