It makes it possible for recording of all motion the camera senses, for as much as 5 minutes in a row. If motion continues beyond that window, the camera ends one clip and quickly starts another, without any gaps in between. Recordings are easy to discover under the Occasions tab at the bottom of the app. Without the subscription, you still get the restricted cloud recording and microSD recording, however we don't recommend that for home security since if it's stolen, you do not have a backup.</p>
