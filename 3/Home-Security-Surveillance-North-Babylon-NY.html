We are indeed one of the very best security companies in the North Western United States.

<p>The Arlo Pro 3 is not excellent however good-- therefore it isn't worth paying twice the rate of its predecessor. When the two are compared side by side, the Arlo Pro 3 does edge out the Pro 2 on battery life and image, with 2K HDR video that is sharper throughout day and nighttime watching. Nevertheless, color night vision image quality is disappointing, and the motion tracking function is a bit wonky. Also, the Pro 3 provides no complimentary storage, and external storage can't be viewed through the app, only via a computer. We will keep monitoring the Arlo Pro 3, but for now, we still believe the Arlo Pro 2 is a better buy. Both are still much better than the expensive Arlo Ultra, which we discovered to have awful night-vision efficiency, poor battery life, and a propensity to miss out on far too many motion triggers.</p>

We would suggest considering a DIY home security system instead if you want to prevent having to sign a contract.</p>
