<p>Lighting: Lots of security cameras are able to shoot in what is referred to as "low-light infrared," enabling them to capture clear video in dark conditions. These cameras depend on infrared LED lights, which cover the dark area in infrared light. Unlike human beings, the camera is able to see this infrared light, so when those wavelengths reflect back, it's as if the camera is shooting video footage in a brightened room. The more IR LEDs that a camera has, the much better it has the ability to see during the night. Make sure your camera has plenty of IR LEDs if recording video in the dark is a concern.</p>

The company also questioned the video, claiming that there would require to be an ideal storm of situations for somebody to successfully hack the system. Over a week, we ran more than 25 tests using 2 different 433 MHz remotes, with contact sensors located 6 to 26 feet far from the SimpliSafe Base Station, and we were unable to replicate the concern.
