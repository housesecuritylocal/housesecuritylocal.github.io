<p>All individuals with alarm systems securing a property in the City of Fredericksburg need to have a valid alarm authorization. The combination of digital video surveillance and access control belongs to the natural convergence of security innovations. Centralizing security into a single interface provides additional details that might never have been possible previously, such as alert of an employee, by name and recognition number, entering the building. An image of that staff member exists on screen for verification (validating it's not a stolen ID), and, through image capture on the security camera, guaranteeing no tailgating occurs.</p>
<p>The smartphone app has 3 modes of operation-- Standby, Home, and Away. When you put the device on Standby mode, you hear a small chirping sound whenever the entry sensors get set off. In Home mode, a loud 93dB alarm is triggered whenever the entry sensors are activated. Lastly, in Away mode, both the motion sensing units and entry sensors are active. These are all fairly intelligent modes, but they can not be altered. You can't alter the sensitivity of the sensing units or arrange them. This also leaves you susceptible to false alarms, particularly if you have small kids or animals in your home. Some people choose the lack of customizability due to the fact that it makes the whole device extremely easy to use. However it can also be a major hindrance for some.</p>
