<p>We deliver value-added security and surveillance systems and services using convenience, peace of mind and fulfillment to every client and are devoted to fulfilling our customer's needs with stability, sincerity, enthusiasm and excellent service. Video surveillance monitoring is as old as the really concept of camera surveillance. Video surveillance has actually come a long method, covering numerous decades. The first video surveillance system was a Closed-Circuit Tv (CCTV) set up in 1942 by German scientists to monitor the launch of rockets. The technology gradually progressed into the highly advanced yet budget-friendly systems available today.
