<p>The DoS attack in itself does little to expose organizational data to a harmful attacker, since the disturbance of the network prevents the circulation of data and in fact indirectly safeguards data by preventing it from being transmitted. The usual factor for carrying out a DoS attack is to observe the healing of the wireless network, during which all of the initial handshake codes are re-transmitted by all devices, providing an opportunity for the destructive opponent to tape these codes and use various breaking tools to evaluate security weaknesses and exploit them to get unauthorized access to the system.
