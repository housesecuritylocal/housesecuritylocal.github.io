<p>There must be a clear line of vision in between wireless transceivers, so that each camera can see" the home building to transmit video. We tried each of the cameras in several places around our house, ranging from 6 feet to 30 feet away from our Wi-Fi router, which was linked to Verizon Fios service.

<p>Not all security cameras operate in the dark. Security cameras that have low-light capabilities have a shutter that allows more light to go into the camera's sensor.
