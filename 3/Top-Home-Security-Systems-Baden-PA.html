Although systems using DSP (digital signal processing) will mostly remove false alarms on some cases.</p>

<p>Video recording isn't a basic option on many security systems. Property owners looking for a system that provides video recording must ensure the alternative is readily available instead of assume it is. Storing video is also an issue. Video files are big, which means a great deal of space is required.

Nest's Secure has the best design of any system I evaluated, including creative things like incorporating a motion and the keypad detector into the base station and integrating motion detectors and entry sensing units into one unit. However the Secure is expensive, additional sensors are costly, and the monitoring service-- which does not consist of fire alarms or camera backups-- is likewise expensive if you don't commit to a three-year agreement.</p>
<p>That, in addition to facial recognition and a built-in Google Assistant, still make the Nest IQ Outdoor cameras a top choice for outdoor security.
