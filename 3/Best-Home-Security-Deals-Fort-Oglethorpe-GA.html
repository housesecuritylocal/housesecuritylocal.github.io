<p>Like the Nest Cam IQ Indoor, this model has Familiar Face notifies, which can determine individuals the camera is finding using face acknowledgment. When it identifies an individual in the frame, it will ask whether you know that individual and if so to tag them by name. After a while, the camera will learn to determine those individuals and will send smart device notifies with that details when they show up at your home. We think this feature (which requires a Nest Aware subscription) is more beneficial outdoors, where you are more likely to want to differentiate expected visitors from random strangers. We also discovered the feature to be more trusted on the IQ Outdoor than on the indoor IQ model (on the indoor design, this feature was always asking us to identify faces on a close-by TELEVISION). Three microphones (versus the Nest Cam Outdoor's one) likewise provide a broader variety of audio, so you can much better hear what's going on in recordings.</p>

If a house owner goes on vacation, for example, he or she can decide to have a monitoring company see their home while they run out town. In this case, the house owner is just charged for the monitored time.</p>
<p>The Arlo Pro 3 is good however not fantastic-- therefore it isn't worth paying twice the rate of its predecessor. When the two are compared side by side, the Arlo Pro 3 does edge out the Pro 2 on battery life and image, with 2K HDR video that is sharper during day and nighttime viewing. Nevertheless, color night vision image quality is disappointing, and the motion tracking feature is a bit wonky. Likewise, the Pro 3 offers no totally free storage, and external storage can't be viewed through the app, just through a computer. We will keep monitoring the Arlo Pro 3, however for now, we still believe the Arlo Pro 2 is a better buy. Both are still better than the pricey Arlo Ultra, which we discovered to have terrible night-vision performance, poor battery life, and a tendency to miss far too many motion sets off.</p>
