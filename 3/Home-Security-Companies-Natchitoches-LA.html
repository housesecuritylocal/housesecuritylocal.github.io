Oftentimes, Cat5e and Cat6 cable televisions will likewise power the security cameras, eliminating the requirement for more electrical wiring. When the security cameras are not connected to an NVR, this is called Power-Over-Ethernet and needs a PoE switch. Wireless security cameras might need less circuitry in the walls but will still require cable televisions to power the security camera individually, usually via 110VAC power.</p>
