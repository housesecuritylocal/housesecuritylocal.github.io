As a result, faces are appropriately exposed at the door and in the shop, accomplishing the objective of recording video of everyone going into the store. HDR is now a basic function in commercial cameras. Sadly, once clients realize that the low-cost customer camera they purchased is doing not have HDR, it's generally too late since the cameras and recorders are installed.</p>
