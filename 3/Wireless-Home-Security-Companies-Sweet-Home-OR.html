<p>One category where SimpliSafe has gotten somewhat dissatisfying reviews is customer support. Since they can often result in extra charges, many users are not very pleased with the method dispatch calls from the monitoring system function for false alarms. Furthermore, the overall viewpoint is that the company's customer service is not really practical when it comes to repeating and fixing issues usage concerns.
