<p>First and foremost, it's tough to dislike the image coming out of this $20 camera. It's not as sharp as our other picks, but it's much better than a great deal of cameras that are 4 times the cost. The field of view is a narrow 110 degrees (compared with 130 on Nest and Netgear and Logitech's 180). However, after nearly 2 years of use, night and day images have actually constantly been clear, and we never ever had problems with the camera missing motion, an issue we came across when testing the Wyze Camera Pan And for those times when you're left questioning why your camera sent out a motion alert, Wyze has a clever function you can toggle on or off called Motion Tagging It produces a green, on-screen box around the motion found.
