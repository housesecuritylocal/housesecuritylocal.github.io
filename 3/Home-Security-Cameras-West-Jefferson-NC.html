<p>I simply completed updating all of my stock annke cameras with this model. The crucial distinction with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal modification which permits you to tweak the field of vision 1000% better than a camera without a horizontal modification. No idea why more bullet cameras do not have this really crucial function. Likewise nice metal building and construction.

Should be a better method to implement that. But it was simply a little notch so not an offer breaker.
