<p>I just ended up updating all of my stock annke cameras with this model. The essential difference with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal adjustment which enables you to modify the field of view 1000% much better than a camera without a horizontal modification. No hint why more bullet cameras do not have this extremely essential function. Also great metal construction. Needed to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get appropriate mode not in white and black. Had to make the wire hole a little larger to fit the big choice device into the wall. Should be a better way to execute that. But it was just a little notch so not an offer breaker. Great resolution - much better field of view vs the stock annke cameras and better clearness during the night. Hopefully these hold up throughout the years! Extremely suggest.</p>
