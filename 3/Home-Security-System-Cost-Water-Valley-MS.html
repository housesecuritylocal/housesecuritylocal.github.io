<p>I explained that all we would require to do is tap into any among the emergency call buttons, input into the Axis camera, which likewise included two-way audio, and that camera would end up being the user interface into the VMS system. When a client presses the emergency button, it sends out double notifies: one to the nurse calling station and the other to the main patient-monitoring command center, through the VMS.

However, there were some issues with connecting the command center to our tester's network.</p>
<p>The circuit and sensors alarm are monitored by the control board - the computer that arms the security system and discovers breaks in the electrical circuit. This control panel has its own power supply, so the burglar can not cut off the power prior to breaching the border. When the circuit is broken, the Control board will either sound an audible alarm or alert the security company - sometimes, both. SMART Link is a free home security smartphone app established by Protect America that allows remote control from anywhere. It offers a total introduction of the home, from the locks on the doors to the live video stream. You'll get an alert from Protect America if in any minute an alarm is activated.</p>
