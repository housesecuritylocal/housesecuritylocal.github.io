<p>As the name recommends, this alarm is a starter set". So it's pretty much anticipated that it will not have extended customizability or a vast array of functions.

<p>Our SSA security system was installed at our new home on Friday, June 23rd. Ron Thompson was our sales expert.

He talked to us concerning placement of some of the monitoring devices in our home. He also helped me in loading the app and completing the online set-up procedure. He also examined the new keypad functionality. Both Darek and Ron were really expert and valuable. Thanks.</p>
<p>Aside from good Wi-Fi, you may also need a close-by outlet. Most cameras need an Air Conditioning connection, which indicates you won't have the ability to put them just anywhere. Several of the cameras we evaluated used the alternative to use battery power, but we have yet to find the ideal one. The models we have actually reviewed so far either record extremely short clips, leave giant spaces in between those brief clips, or require charging regularly.</p>

<p>One classification where SimpliSafe has gotten somewhat dissatisfying reviews is customer support. Many users are not very pleased with the method dispatch calls from the monitoring system function for incorrect alarms because they can often result in additional charges. Additionally, the overall viewpoint is that the company's customer care is not extremely practical when it pertains to repairing problems and repeating use issues.

Nevertheless, get past that fiddly start and you find this is a pretty decent home security camera.</p>
