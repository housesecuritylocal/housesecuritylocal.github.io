In the worst case, all that would be required is an additional PoE switch. Some IP cameras are also wireless and can transmit footage to the NVR over Wi-Fi. There are no proximity constraints so long as a camera is linked to the same network as the NVR. The biggest disadvantage to an NVR system, however, is that not every IP camera will work with every NVR.
