<p>I" m not satisfied with this item. It requires an addition hard disk drive for storage and a cd disk to program in order to record. The photo quality is good. The motion sensors work well. I would not recommend it though. People who are tech-savvy or pressed for time may choose to install their own systems to prevent scheduling visits and requiring time off from work. Employing a technician costs more, however for those who prefer to let an expert handle the task and don't mind spending the additional money, expert installation is the method to go.</p>
<p>The real reason cameras are generally released is to minimize much pettier criminal activities. But it has actually not even been shown that they can do that.

"When the criminal activity and offence figures were adapted to take account of the basic downward trend in offenses and crimes," criminologists discovered in one research study, "decreases were noted in specific classifications but there was no evidence to suggest that the cameras had minimized crime in general in the city centre." A 2005 research study for the British Office also found that cameras did not cut criminal activity or the worry of crime (as had a 2002 research study, likewise for the British government).</p>
