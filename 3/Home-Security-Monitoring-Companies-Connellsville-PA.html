<p>Our CCTV surveillance camera systems are trusted by more than 60,000 organisations, universities, and federal government facilities, and residential customers. A basic system will generally only include the control board, sensing units, and an audible alarm. If you want any other functions, you will either have to buy a more advanced package or add-on to your basic system, which, depending upon the brand name, could get pricey.

<p>The smart device app has three modes of operation-- Standby, Home, and Away.

These are all fairly intelligent modes, but they can not be altered. You can't alter the sensitivity of the sensing units or arrange them. This also leaves you susceptible to false alarms, specifically if you have small kids or family pets in your home. Some people choose the lack of customizability due to the fact that it makes the entire device extremely simple to use. However it can also be a significant limitation for some.</p>
