SimpliSafe creates and offers its own gadgets. The quality of this equipment appears acceptable to most users, though it can't be used with a various monitoring service like third-party equipment might. ADT is one of the more expensive home security companies, with expensive video monitoring and steep early termination fees. But ADT is known to use deals that reduce the cost of equipment, that makes the overall cost for a 36-month contract a lot more sensible.</p>

<p>The Arlo Pro 3 is not excellent but good-- therefore it isn't worth paying twice the cost of its predecessor. When the 2 are compared side by side, the Arlo Pro 3 does edge out the Pro 2 on battery life and image, with 2K HDR video that is sharper during day and nighttime watching. However, color night vision image quality is frustrating, and the motion tracking feature is a bit wonky. Likewise, the Pro 3 uses no free storage, and external storage can't be viewed through the app, just via a computer system. We will keep monitoring the Arlo Pro 3, however for now, we still believe the Arlo Pro 2 is a much better buy. Both are still much better than the expensive Arlo Ultra, which we found to have horrible night-vision efficiency, bad battery life, and a propensity to miss out on far too many motion triggers.</p>
