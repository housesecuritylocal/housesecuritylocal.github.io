<p>Arlo declares that you should have the ability to get four to six months out of a completely charged battery, depending upon settings, usage, and surrounding temperature. In long-lasting testing of the camera, we generally got half that, unless the camera was dealing with a low-traffic location. If you're stressed over charging, Arlo offers a solar panel, which we have not checked. The Arlo's operating temperature level range is -4 degrees Fahrenheit to 113 degrees Fahrenheit. Throughout testing, we had two Arlo Pro cameras established outside in temperatures that fluctuated between 30 degrees Fahrenheit and 80 degrees Fahrenheit. After one full month, the camera that saw less action was still running at 80 percent. The one pointed at a hectic street was standing strong at 60 percent. During long-term screening, we put the camera in a business parking area that saw a good quantity of weekly traffic. This drained the camera down to the point where it required a full charge once a month.</p>
