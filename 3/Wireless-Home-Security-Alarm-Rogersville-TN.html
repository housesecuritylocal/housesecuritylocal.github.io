<p>No calls from a monitoring company: A self-monitored system avoids talking to someone from the monitoring company when an alarm is triggered. Let's face it, false alarms are relatively common. If a homeowner forgets their secrets and goes back inside with the alarm engaged, or an outdoor motion sensing unit is triggered by an area feline, it can trigger the alarm. With a professionally monitored system, the property owner will be called by the monitoring company whenever the alarm goes off, unless the property owner disables it quickly. False alarms happen.

<p>Throughout our screening, this compact camera taped sharp, 1080p HD images day and night, and its digital zoom was useful for taking a more detailed look.

<p>Not all security cameras work in the dark. Security cameras that have low-light capabilities have a shutter that permits more light to go into the camera's sensor. The more light that is permitted to enter the camera the brighter the image will be. However, even these low light capable cameras have digital sound that make the dark image appearance fuzzy. To combat this fuzzy image some security cameras come geared up with 2D and 3D digital noise reduction Some security cameras now feature infrared light that is unnoticeable to the human eye however can be gotten by a security camera's sensor.</p>
