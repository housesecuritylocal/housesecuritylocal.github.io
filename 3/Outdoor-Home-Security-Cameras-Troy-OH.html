<p>The Arlo Pro 3 is good however not terrific-- therefore it isn't worth paying two times the price of its predecessor. When the 2 are compared side by side, the Arlo Pro 3 does edge out the Pro 2 on battery life and image, with 2K HDR video that is sharper throughout day and nighttime viewing. Nevertheless, color night vision image quality is disappointing, and the motion tracking function is a bit wonky. Likewise, the Pro 3 offers no totally free storage, and external storage can't be seen through the app, only through a computer. We will keep monitoring the Arlo Pro 3, but for now, we still believe the Arlo Pro 2 is a much better buy. Both are still much better than the expensive Arlo Ultra, which we found to have horrible night-vision efficiency, bad battery life, and a tendency to miss out on far a lot of motion sets off.</p>
<p>The motion detection is excellent, and the app is a pleasure to utilize too (a lot better than the apps you get with some budget plan security cameras), though if you want to enter into its cleverest customisations, there is a bit of a learning curve. For even more basic smarts, it's great, though. If you do not currently have an Arlo camera or two in place, you're going to need to install a hub that's wired to your router, so bear that in mind - the cameras all connect to the center (not to your Wi-Fi), and this can suggest there are variety concerns.</p>
