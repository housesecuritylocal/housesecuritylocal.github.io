Burglar alarm allows need a one-time registration fee of $45. There is no yearly renewal charge and the authorization remains in place as long as the alarm system is in usage at the same address.

You're just accountable for the monthly monitoring charge and any optional upgrades. There's also a cost match warranty.</p>
