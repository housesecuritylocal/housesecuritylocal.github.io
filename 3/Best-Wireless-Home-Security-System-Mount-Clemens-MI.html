Video surveillance monitoring is as old as the extremely concept of camera surveillance. Video surveillance has come a long method, spanning several years. The first video surveillance system was a Closed-Circuit Tv (CCTV) installed in 1942 by German scientists to monitor the launch of rockets.

The first uses of CCTV cameras required monitoring the feed in real-time - i.e., they did not have the ways to tape video and enjoy it later on. Although video surveillance was monitored out of necessity in the early days, nowadays it is a deliberate practice to improve the outcome of security systems.</p>
<p>The smart device app has three moduses operandi-- Standby, Home, and Away. When you position the gadget on Standby mode, you hear a small chirping sound whenever the entry sensors get activated.

<p>We discovered the Circle 2 isn't quite as good as the Nest Camera for outdoor usage. It has a 10-foot power cable that limits positioning, and it isn't weatherproof (you can include a weatherproof cable, however doing so makes each unit cost more than a single Nest). Also, if you do not choose to use HomeKit Secure Video you'll need to sign up for a $10 regular monthly Circle Safe subscription to have recording storage and advanced functions, such as alerts that compare people and basic motion. We think that's costly.</p>
