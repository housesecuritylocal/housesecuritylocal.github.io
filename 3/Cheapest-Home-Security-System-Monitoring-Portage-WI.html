<p>The Wyze Webcam v2 is the Cinderella story of security cameras. Previously, we didn't consider it to be a powerful security choice (although we loved it as a pet webcam ). It has actually since been enhanced and now matches our top choices due to the addition of a new cloud service, two-factor authentication for security, and several smart-home integration alternatives.
