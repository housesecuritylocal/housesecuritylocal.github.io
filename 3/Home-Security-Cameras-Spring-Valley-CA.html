<p>Unlike the majority of other cameras we tested, the corded Circle 2 does not have sensitivity settings for motion detection (though the cordless model does ). Instead, you can filter occasion notifications only by high activity, days, or individual (the latter is offered just with a paid Circle Safe subscription). Without a paid Circle Safe membership, you'll get more notifies, which you can just filter to receive every minute, 15 minutes, or 30 minutes. The subscription is better when utilized in high-traffic locations. Otherwise, the Smart Location function can be set to disable recording when you're home-- to prevent alerts each time you stroll by. Oddly, though the app supports multiple users, its geofencing applies to each user individually, so if everybody in your household has the Circle app installed, you'll still get notifications when other people are home.</p>
