The crucial difference with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal change which allows you to modify the field of vision 1000% much better than a camera without a horizontal modification. No clue why more bullet cameras do not have this extremely essential function. Likewise good metal construction. Needed to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the delegated get right mode not in black and white. Needed to make the wire hole a little larger to fit the huge choice device into the wall.
