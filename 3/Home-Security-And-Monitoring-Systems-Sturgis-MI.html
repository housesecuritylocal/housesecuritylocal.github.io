<p>We found the Circle 2 isn't rather as good as the Nest Webcam for outdoor use. It has a 10-foot power cable that restricts positioning, and it isn't weatherproof (you can add a weatherproof cord, however doing so makes each unit cost more than a single Nest). Also, if you don't choose to utilize HomeKit Secure Video you'll need to register for a $10 monthly Circle Safe subscription to have taping storage and advanced features, such as notices that compare people and basic motion. We think that's expensive.</p>

<p>Regardless of having an operating temperature of -4 degrees Fahrenheit to 122 degrees Fahrenheit, the Circle 2 can be more difficult to install due to its limited, 10-foot cable and non-weatherproof plug. (You can safeguard that plug and add another 15 feet of cable with the $30 extension set, or acquire a Window Mount or a Plug Mount) This indicates the Circle 2 ends up being more pricey general per unit than the Nest camera if you want a weatherproof solution. Logitech does make a cordless variation of the Circle 2, though we don't recommend it because its battery-saving routines can interrupt efficiency.</p>
