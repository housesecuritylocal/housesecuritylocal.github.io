Nevertheless, in any scenario where standard-definition camera are utilized, the quality is going to be poor because the optimum pixel resolution of the image chips in most of these gadgets is 320,000 pixels (analogue quality is determined in TV lines but the outcomes are the exact same); they generally capture vertical and horizontal fields of lines and mix them together to make a single frame; the maximum frame rate is generally 30 frames per second.</p>
