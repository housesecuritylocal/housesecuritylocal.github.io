Considering that this camera has no native geofencing functions, you have to manually stop notices (and recording, considering that it does that even when alerts are off). We also experienced above-average connectivity problems, with 2 Hive test systems disconnecting 8 times over two months. Scout is very simple to use, particularly if you're a fan of mobile devices. The Scout mobile app works for iOS, Android, and web-based web browsers, and it enables you to control almost every aspect of the security system remotely, and it's highly personalized.
