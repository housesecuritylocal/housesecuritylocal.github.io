CCTV is also grounded in situational criminal activity avoidance method, which argues that chances to anger can be lowered by changing a variety of systems such as increasing the risk of an offender being collared, increasing the effort to dedicate the criminal activity, reducing benefits from criminal activity commission, and lowering justifications that generate criminal chances (La Vigne et al. 2011). This means that the offender must understand the added surveillance for it to accomplish its desired impact.</p>
