Had to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the delegated get proper mode not in black and white. Had to make the wire hole a little bigger to fit the substantial choice device into the wall. Should be a much better method to implement that. However it was just a little notch so not a deal breaker. Great resolution - much better field of view vs the stock annke cameras and much better clearness in the evening. Ideally these hold up throughout the years! Extremely suggest.</p>
