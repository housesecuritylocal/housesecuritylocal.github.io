<p>Like the Nest Camera IQ Indoor, this model has Familiar Face signals, which can identify individuals the camera is spotting utilizing face recognition. When it finds a person in the frame, it will ask whether you know that individual and if so to tag them by name. After a while, the camera will discover to determine those people and will send smart device notifies with that info when they appear at your home.
