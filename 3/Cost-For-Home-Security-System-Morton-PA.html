<p>Simply purchased a bullet ip system and absolutely like it. Great clearness. I wished to set up viewing on my cell phone but had a couple questions that the tech responded to with ease. I Would absolutely buy from cctvsecuritypros once again. I extremely suggest this company. The Nest Aware service is what makes this camera stick out-- it's what provides the video history and smarter alerts, for example. However, those functions come at a relatively steep rate: $5 monthly ($50 per year) for the first camera for five days of video history, $10 per month ($100 annually) for 10 days of video history, or $30 monthly ($300 annually) for one month of video history.

For longer access to video, anticipate to pay a month-to-month storage cost.</p>
