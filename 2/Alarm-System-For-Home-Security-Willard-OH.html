However I likewise appreciate minimalist systems that components that perform more than one action, like Minut. Some components can make home automation available to you. Whatever the parts are (camera, motion sensor, window sensor, smart lock, etc.), I wish to ensure that they all quickly interact with your app that is constantly at hand, so you can watch on them from afar.</p>
