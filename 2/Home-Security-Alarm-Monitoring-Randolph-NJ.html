<p>Lighting: Numerous security cameras have the ability to shoot in what is referred to as "low-light infrared," allowing them to capture clear footage in dark conditions. These cameras rely on infrared LED lights, which cover the dark location in infrared light. Unlike humans, the camera is able to see this infrared light, so when those wavelengths reflect back, it's as if the camera is shooting footage in a lit up room. The more IR LEDs that a camera has, the better it has the ability to see at night. Make sure your camera has plenty of IR LEDs if capturing footage in the dark is a priority.</p>
<p>Storage: We restricted our testing to cameras with cloud storage, whether it's totally free or for a monthly charge. Local storage on a microSD card is also good to have; just know that locally saved video footage can be stolen if somebody notices the camera.

<p>When utilizing IP cameras - as the majority of CCTV systems do these days - you will probably be taking a look at Cat5E or Cat6 cables, which can move the large amount of data needed by digital video and high resolutions at very fast speeds, and typically over fars away. This is an upgrade from the coax cabling that generally powers analog security cameras; coax cables are trustworthy, however not compatible with IP cameras. In a lot of cases, Cat5e and Cat6 cable televisions will likewise power the security cameras, removing the need for more electrical wiring. This is called Power-Over-Ethernet and needs a PoE switch when the security cameras are not linked to an NVR. Wireless security cameras may require less circuitry in the walls however will still require cable televisions to power the security camera individually, normally through 110VAC power.</p>
<p>I have this camera connected to my home computer as part of my home surveillance system. With the long USB cable, I was able place the camera around 10 feet away from my desk aiming into my hallway. The security program I use is "blue iris" which had the ability to find the camera without difficulty. The IR lights in the evening are able to throw light a good 20 feet in a tight circle. Not as dispersed as I would like. It's not nearly as clear as my foscam F9821P, nor is the lighting as good, however it was half the price and it doesn't consume my wifi bandwidth.</p>
<p>Local storage: Some cameras consist of memory-card slots in lieu of, or in addition to, cloud storage, so you can keep video right on the device. It's an attractive feature as it can get rid of the cost of regular monthly storage fees.

<p>We found the Circle 2 isn't rather as good as the Nest Webcam for outdoor use. It has a 10-foot power cord that limits placement, and it isn't weatherproof (you can add a weatherproof cord, but doing so makes each system cost more than a single Nest). Likewise, if you do not choose to use HomeKit Secure Video you'll require to register for a $10 regular monthly Circle Safe subscription to have taping storage and advanced functions, such as alerts that compare individuals and basic motion. We think that's pricey.</p>

<p>The XT2's case is weatherproof, so you can stick it either indoors or outside, and features a practical mounting bracket. While not tops, the 1080p video is records benefits the price, and most importantly, it includes complimentary cloud storage (up to 2 hours in overall).
