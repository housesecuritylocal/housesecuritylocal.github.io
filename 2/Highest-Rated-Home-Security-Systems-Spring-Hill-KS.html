However, there are a few things you need to know before you run out and buy one.</p>

If motion continues beyond that window, the camera ends one clip and quickly begins another, with no spaces in between. Recordings are easy to find under the Occasions tab at the bottom of the app. Without the membership, you still get the limited cloud recording and microSD recording, however we don't recommend that for home security since if it's taken, you don't have a backup.</p>

The models we have actually evaluated up until now either record very short clips, leave giant gaps in between those short clips, or need charging regularly.</p>
