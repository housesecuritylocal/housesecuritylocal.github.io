<p>We deliver value-added security and surveillance systems and services offering benefit, assurance and complete satisfaction to every consumer and are dedicated to fulfilling our client's requirements with integrity, honesty, enthusiasm and exceptional service. Video surveillance monitoring is as old as the really concept of camera surveillance. Video surveillance has come a long way, spanning several years. The very first video surveillance system was a Closed-Circuit Tv (CCTV) installed in 1942 by German scientists to monitor the launch of rockets. The technology slowly evolved into the highly advanced yet inexpensive systems offered today. The very first uses of CCTV cameras needed monitoring the feed in real-time - i.e., they did not have the ways to tape video and enjoy it later on.

Some people would rather pay an alarm company the regular monthly monitoring rate rather of purchasing a self-monitored security system. Expertly monitored security systems require a monthly monitoring cost that can vary from ($ 20 to $60) per month.
