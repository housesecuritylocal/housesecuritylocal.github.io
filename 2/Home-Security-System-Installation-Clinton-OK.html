Alternatively, the screen can be made so thick that there is no requirement for a supporting chainwire fence. These systems are created to spot any physical attempt to penetrate the barrier. Taut wire systems can operate with a variety of switches or detectors that notice motion at each end of the tense wires. These detectors or switches can be a simple mechanical contact, fixed force transducer or an electronic pressure gauge. Undesirable alarms brought on by birds and other animals can be avoided by adjusting the sensors to disregard things that put in percentages of pressure on the wires.
