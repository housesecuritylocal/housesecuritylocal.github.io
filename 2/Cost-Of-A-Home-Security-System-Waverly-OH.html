<p>Finally, I check out a home security system's app, ensuring it's technologically sound and easy to use, especially if there is home automation involved. I also inspect app reviews from the Apple and the Google Play stores, looking for home security apps with ratings of a minimum of three stars or above.

Remember that the more additionals and features you contribute to your system, the bigger the price tag. Some top-tier packages cost up of $60 each month. That's still considerable, however it's a lot less than the typical loss of a break-in.

On the other hand, it's considerably harder to hack into a hardwired system. There's also a guaranteed convenience aspect included, because wired systems can use control panels in several spaces as well as high-definition (HD) video surveillance. Plus, wired systems can deal with more sensing units, which can be extended amongst multiple buildings on a given residential or commercial property.</p>
<p>I" m not satisfied with this product. It needs an addition hard disk for storage and a cd disk to program in order to record. The picture quality is good. The motion sensing units work well. I wouldn't recommend it though. People who are tech-savvy or pressed for time might prefer to install their own systems to avoid scheduling consultations and taking time off from work. Employing a technician costs more, but for those who prefer to let an expert deal with the task and do not mind spending the money, professional installation is the method to go.</p>
