In long-term testing of the camera, we normally got half that, unless the camera was facing a low-traffic area. If you're worried about charging, Arlo offers a solar panel, which we have not checked. The Arlo's operating temperature level range is -4 degrees Fahrenheit to 113 degrees Fahrenheit. Throughout testing, we had two Arlo Pro cameras set up outside in temperatures that fluctuated in between 30 degrees Fahrenheit and 80 degrees Fahrenheit. After one complete month, the camera that saw less action was still performing at 80 percent. The one pointed at a hectic street was standing strong at 60 percent.
