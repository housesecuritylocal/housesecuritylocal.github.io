Most cameras with taping capabilities have an integrated secure digital (SD) or microSD slot that permits sufficient tape-recording area. When the sd card is full, you'll need to delete video footage or store it elsewhere. Some popular cameras immediately override expired videos, which might not be most perfect if you need to keep a video.

As far as anyone is concerned, the image looks completely regular given that the doorway and room appear to be at the exact same brightness level. As an outcome, faces are effectively exposed at the door and in the shop, achieving the goal of capturing video of everyone going into the shop. HDR is now a standard feature in commercial cameras.

However, we had a handful of tests where recordings eliminated in the middle of the action and would leave 13-second spaces in between clips.
