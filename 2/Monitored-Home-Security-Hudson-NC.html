<p>Houston home alarm companies that use complimentary" alarm are just concealing the equipment cost in your 3-5-year contract. That equipment is spent for within the first year, but do they decrease your rate once it's settled? No. You're stuck at that $60-$ 70 regular monthly rate for a minimum of another 2+ years. That forces you to significantly overpay. Besides overpaying, what if their service is bad? Too bad, you're trapped in their contract.</p>
