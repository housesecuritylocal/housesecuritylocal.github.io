<p>I just finished updating all of my stock annke cameras with this design. The essential difference with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal adjustment which enables you to fine-tune the field of view 1000% better than a camera without a horizontal adjustment. No hint why more bullet cameras do not have this very important function. Likewise great metal building and construction. Needed to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get proper mode not in white and black. Had to make the wire hole a little bigger to fit the huge choice device into the wall. Must be a much better method to carry out that. But it was simply a little notch so not an offer breaker. Great resolution - far better field of vision vs the stock annke cameras and better clarity in the evening. Hopefully these hold up over the years! Highly advise.</p>

<p>A wireless home security system utilizes a radio frequency to interact with the control panel and sensors. The control board then communicates with a monitoring center using a cellular signal.

<p>No calls from a monitoring company: A self-monitored system prevents speaking to someone from the monitoring company when an alarm is activated. Let's face it, false alarms are fairly typical. If a house owner forgets their secrets and goes back within with the alarm engaged, or an outdoor motion sensor is set off by a neighborhood feline, it can set off the alarm. With an expertly monitored system, the house owner will be called by the monitoring company each time the alarm goes off, unless the house owner disables it quickly. False alarms occur. With a self-monitored system, a house owner will not receive calls from a monitoring company. Instead, property owners access the alarm themselves and take the essential action.</p>
