<p>I simply completed updating all of my stock annke cameras with this design. The crucial difference with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal adjustment which enables you to tweak the field of view 1000% better than a camera without a horizontal modification. No idea why more bullet cameras do not have this really essential function. Also good metal construction. Had to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get proper mode not in white and black. Had to make the wire hole a little bigger to fit the substantial selection device into the wall. Should be a better way to execute that. But it was simply a little notch so not an offer breaker. Great resolution - far better field of vision vs the stock annke cameras and much better clarity in the evening. Ideally these hold up throughout the years! Extremely recommend.</p>
