Well, it's a prepackaged security package that offers basic intrusion protection with super-low regular monthly monitoring costs. Or ... no monitoring charges at all if you pick the free self-monitor" alternative.</p>

With the majority of self-monitored systems, there's no need to connect to a home's electrical grid and even drill holes to mount sensors.

Many people who? consider it correct etiquette to leave access points available to the general public, enabling open door to Web. Others who? think the default encryption offers significant protection at small hassle, against dangers of open access that they fear may be significant even on a home DSL router.</p>
