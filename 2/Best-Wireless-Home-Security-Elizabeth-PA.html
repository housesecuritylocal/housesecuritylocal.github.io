<p>A taut wire perimeter security system is basically an independent screen of tensioned tripwires typically installed on a fence or wall. Additionally, the screen can be made so thick that there is no need for a supporting chainwire fence. These systems are designed to spot any physical attempt to penetrate the barrier. Tight wire systems can operate with a variety of switches or detectors that pick up movement at each end of the tense wires. These switches or detectors can be an easy mechanical contact, fixed force transducer or an electronic strain gauge. Unwanted alarms triggered by birds and other animals can be prevented by changing the sensing units to neglect items that apply percentages of pressure on the wires. This kind of system is susceptible to trespassers digging under the fence. A concrete footing directly below the fence is set up to prevent this type of attack.</p>

ADT also works with Google Assistant and Amazon Alexa so you can manage your security system with your voice. 10,000 careful people with mobile phones is much better security than one security person enjoying 10,000 individuals on CCTV.</p>
