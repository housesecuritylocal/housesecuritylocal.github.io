<p>At night, though it lacks the full IR LED selection of some competitors, the Arlo records enough light to see a good range, and there's an adjustable spotlight readily available if you're placing it outdoors - which nicely brings us to the wonderful motion detection. Not just is the Arlo quick to pick out moving products, it's brainy enough to make a decent stab at working out precisely what it's looking at. Just a couple decades back, the home security industry was controlled by a few huge names providing expensive, stiff strategies with little flexibility and hostile, long-lasting agreements. Systems were limited to a couple wired motion sensors connected to a keypad control board and go through a landline. Nowadays, this has all changed.</p>
<p>The motion detection is excellent, and the app is a satisfaction to use as well (a lot better than the apps you get with some budget plan security cameras), though if you want to enter into its cleverest customisations, there is a little a learning curve. For all the more basic smarts, it's excellent, though. If you don't currently have an Arlo camera or two in place, you're going to need to install a center that's wired to your router, so bear that in mind - the cameras all link to the center (not to your Wi-Fi), and this can imply there are range issues.</p>
