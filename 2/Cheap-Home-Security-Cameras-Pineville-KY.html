<p>I just ended up updating all of my stock annke cameras with this design. The key distinction with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal change which allows you to tweak the field of view 1000% much better than a camera without a horizontal adjustment. No hint why more bullet cameras do not have this really essential function. Also good metal construction. Needed to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the delegated get appropriate mode not in black and white. Had to make the wire hole a little bigger to fit the big selection gadget into the wall. Should be a much better way to carry out that. However it was simply a little notch so not a deal breaker.
