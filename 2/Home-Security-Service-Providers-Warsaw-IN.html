After screening, we sent each of our top picks, along with the Wyze Camera v2, to Expense McKinley, head of information security at The New york city Times (Wirecutter's parent company), for hack screening. (Expense is also a self-proclaimed paranoid infosec guy.") He evaluated each camera for any outstanding security defects and concluded that all of our top picks and the budget plan Wyze Camera passed basic security standards and defenses.</p>

<p>We discovered the Circle 2 isn't rather as good as the Nest Webcam for outdoor usage. It has a 10-foot power cable that limits placement, and it isn't weatherproof (you can include a weatherproof cable, however doing so makes each unit cost more than a single Nest). Also, if you don't opt to use HomeKit Secure Video you'll need to sign up for a $10 monthly Circle Safe subscription to have tape-recording storage and advanced features, such as notifications that distinguish between individuals and basic motion. We believe that's expensive.</p>
