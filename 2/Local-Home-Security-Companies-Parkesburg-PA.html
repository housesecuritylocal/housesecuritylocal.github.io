<p>A number of our rivals in the security system area can't match the unequaled quality of service we provide. Whereas other security providers tend to trap clients into CCTV upkeep agreements that are hard to understand, we offer upfront explanations with transparent prices designs.

Thankfully, their systems are Do It Yourself; we had our sensing units and cameras installed in about 25 minutes (not great, however not dreadful).
