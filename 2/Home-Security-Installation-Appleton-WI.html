Video surveillance monitoring is as old as the really concept of camera surveillance. Video surveillance has actually come a long way, covering several years. The first video surveillance system was a Closed-Circuit Television (CCTV) set up in 1942 by German researchers to monitor the launch of rockets. The technology gradually progressed into the extremely advanced yet budget friendly systems offered today. The first usages of CCTV cameras required monitoring the feed in real-time - i.e., they did not have the methods to tape-record video and see it later. Although video surveillance was monitored out of necessity in the early days, nowadays it is an intentional practice to improve the result of security systems.</p>

Some people would rather pay an alarm company the regular monthly monitoring rate instead of buying a self-monitored security system. Expertly monitored security systems require a month-to-month monitoring cost that can range from ($ 20 to $60) per month. When figuring out just how much a burglar alarm costs consumers need to recognize that if they add more functions, the cost will increase.</p>

It sounds an alarm within the home (frequently incredibly high decibel so that you can hear it as can next-door neighbors in some cases) and sounds an alarm with a professional monitoring company.
