<p>I just ended up upgrading all of my stock annke cameras with this design. The key distinction with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal modification which allows you to modify the field of view 1000% much better than a camera without a horizontal modification. No idea why more bullet cameras do not have this really important function. Also nice metal building and construction. Needed to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get correct mode not in white and black. Needed to make the wire hole a little bigger to fit the huge choice device into the wall. Need to be a much better method to carry out that. But it was just a little notch so not an offer breaker. Very good resolution - much better field of view vs the stock annke cameras and far better clarity at night. Hopefully these hold up over the years! Highly recommend.</p>
