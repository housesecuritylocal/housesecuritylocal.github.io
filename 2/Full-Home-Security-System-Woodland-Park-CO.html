<p>All of this will cost you, though: A single camera (with the center) is $399, and additional cameras are $299 each. The Arlo Ultra doesn't included a totally free tier of cloud storage, so you need to invest a minimum of $3 per month if you want to save any videos. And if you want to save 4K videos, it's an extra $1.99 per camera monthly, on top of the monthly plan, the latter of which is waived for the very first year. However if you desire the outright best when it comes to video quality, the Arlo Ultra has it.</p>
