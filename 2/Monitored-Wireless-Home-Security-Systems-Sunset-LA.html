<p>I just completed upgrading all of my stock annke cameras with this design. The key distinction with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal change which permits you to tweak the field of vision 1000% much better than a camera without a horizontal modification. No idea why more bullet cameras do not have this really important feature. Likewise nice metal construction. Had to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get appropriate mode not in black and white. Had to make the wire hole a little larger to fit the big selection gadget into the wall. Should be a much better way to implement that. However it was just a little notch so not an offer breaker. Very good resolution - better field of view vs the stock annke cameras and far better clarity during the night. Hopefully these hold up for many years! Highly advise.</p>
