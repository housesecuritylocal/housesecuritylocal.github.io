<p>The Arlo Pro 3 is good but not excellent-- therefore it isn't worth paying twice the cost of its predecessor. When the two are compared side by side, the Arlo Pro 3 does edge out the Pro 2 on battery life and image, with 2K HDR video that is sharper throughout day and nighttime watching. Nevertheless, color night vision image quality is disappointing, and the motion tracking function is a bit wonky. Likewise, the Pro 3 uses no complimentary storage, and external storage can't be viewed through the app, just via a computer system. We will keep monitoring the Arlo Pro 3, but for now, we still think the Arlo Pro 2 is a much better buy. Both are still much better than the costly Arlo Ultra, which we discovered to have dreadful night-vision efficiency, poor battery life, and a propensity to miss far too many motion activates.</p>
<p>The motion detection is top notch, and the app is a satisfaction to use too (a lot better than the apps you get with some budget security cameras), though if you wish to enter into its cleverest customisations, there is a bit of a learning curve. For even more basic smarts, it's excellent, though. If you do not currently have an Arlo camera or two in place, you're going to need to install a hub that's wired to your router, so bear that in mind - the cameras all link to the center (not to your Wi-Fi), and this can mean there are range problems.</p>
