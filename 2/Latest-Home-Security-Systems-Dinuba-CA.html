<p>The Hive View delivers excellent 1080p images day and night, however the motion activation triggered too quickly, even when on the most affordable level of sensitivity setting. Because this camera has no native geofencing features, you have to by hand stop alerts (and recording, since it does that even when notices are off). We likewise experienced above-average connection problems, with two Hive test units detaching eight times over 2 months. Scout is extremely simple to utilize, particularly if you're a fan of mobile devices. The Scout mobile app works for iOS, Android, and web-based browsers, and it allows you to manage practically every aspect of the security system remotely, and it's highly personalized. Inside the app, you can even manage e-mail memberships, SMS signals, or the in-app notifications.</p>

<p>Regardless of having an operating temperature of -4 degrees Fahrenheit to 122 degrees Fahrenheit, the Circle 2 can be harder to install due to its limited, 10-foot cable and non-weatherproof plug. (You can protect that plug and add another 15 feet of cable with the $30 extension set, or buy a Window Mount or a Plug Mount) This implies the Circle 2 winds up being more pricey overall per system than the Nest camera if you desire a weatherproof option. Logitech does make a cordless version of the Circle 2, though we do not recommend it because its battery-saving regimens can disrupt efficiency.</p>
