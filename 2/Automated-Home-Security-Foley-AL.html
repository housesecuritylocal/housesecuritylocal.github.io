We tried each of the cameras in numerous places around our house, ranging from 6 feet to 30 feet away from our Wi-Fi router, which was connected to Verizon Fios service. When possible, we tested each camera using an iOS device (an iPhone 7 and an iPad) in addition to an Android mobile phone (using a Nokia 3.1 running Android 9 Pie). Control: Because smart alarm systems do not need to involve an alarm monitoring company, the consumer can retain control.
