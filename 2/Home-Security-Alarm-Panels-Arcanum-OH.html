<h3>Monitored Home Security Systems in Ohio</h3>
<p>In August 2019, the LockPickingLawyer YouTube channel posted a video demonstrating how to hack into a SimpliSafe system using a $2 remote. SimpliSafe reacted with a statement saying the system would signal users when it discovered any type of interference.

Over a week, we ran more than 25 tests using 2 different 433 MHz remotes, with contact sensing units located 6 to 26 feet away from the SimpliSafe Base Station, and we were unable to reproduce the concern. Although our testing should not be taken as definitive, we believe this issue is unlikely to be a real-world problem for SimpliSafe consumers who own the present system.</p>
