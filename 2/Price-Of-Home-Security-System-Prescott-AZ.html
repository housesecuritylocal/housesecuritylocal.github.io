If the system was not set up during the homebuilding procedure, setting one up may require drilling holes into walls, running new wires, covering drywall and gaining access to hard spots that are sealed in attics or basements.

SimpliSafe responded with a statement stating the system would signal users when it found any type of disturbance.
