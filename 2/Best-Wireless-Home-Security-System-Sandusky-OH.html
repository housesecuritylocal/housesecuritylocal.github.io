Furthermore, high resolution allows for full-color feeds and exceptionally detailed images along with night vision abilities. There are a series of CCTV camera types and specifications on the market.</p>
<p>Technology integration is one Vivint's strong points. The company's remarkable mobile app has been highly ranked by users on both Google Play and the App Shop.
