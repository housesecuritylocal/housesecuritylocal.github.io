<p>Regardless of having an operating temperature level of -4 degrees Fahrenheit to 122 degrees Fahrenheit, the Circle 2 can be harder to install due to its limited, 10-foot cable television and non-weatherproof plug. (You can protect that plug and include another 15 feet of cable with the $30 extension set, or buy a Window Mount or a Plug Mount) This suggests the Circle 2 winds up being more expensive overall per system than the Nest camera if you want a weatherproof option. Logitech does make a cordless version of the Circle 2, though we don't suggest it since its battery-saving regimens can disrupt efficiency.</p>
