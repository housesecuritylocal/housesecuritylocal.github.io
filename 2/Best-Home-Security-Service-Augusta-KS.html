When it finds an individual in the frame, it will ask whether you know that individual and if so to tag them by name. After a while, the camera will learn to recognize those people and will send smartphone informs with that info when they show up at your home. We think this function (which requires a Nest Aware membership) is more worthwhile outdoors, where you are most likely to want to distinguish anticipated visitors from random strangers. We likewise found the function to be more trustworthy on the IQ Outdoor than on the indoor IQ design (on the indoor design, this function was constantly asking us to determine faces on a close-by TV). Three microphones (versus the Nest Webcam Outdoor's one) also provide a larger variety of audio, so you can better hear what's going on in recordings.</p>
<p>In the process of writing this guide, we spoke with peers, home security specialists, police departments, and insurance coverage representatives.

<p>We found the Circle 2 isn't quite as good as the Nest Cam for outdoor usage. It has a 10-foot power cable that limits placement, and it isn't weatherproof (you can add a weatherproof cable, however doing so makes each unit cost more than a single Nest). Also, if you do not decide to use HomeKit Secure Video you'll require to sign up for a $10 monthly Circle Safe membership to have recording storage and advanced functions, such as notifications that distinguish between people and general motion. We believe that's pricey.</p>
