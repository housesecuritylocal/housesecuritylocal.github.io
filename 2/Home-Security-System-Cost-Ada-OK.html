<p>Lighting: Many security cameras are able to shoot in what is called "low-light infrared," allowing them to catch clear footage in dark conditions. These cameras count on infrared LED lights, which cover the darkened area in infrared light. Unlike human beings, the camera is able to see this infrared light, so when those wavelengths show back, it's as if the camera is shooting footage in an illuminated room. The more IR LEDs that a camera has, the much better it has the ability to see during the night. Make sure your camera has plenty of IR LEDs if catching video in the dark is a concern.</p>
