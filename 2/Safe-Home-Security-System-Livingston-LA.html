<p>SimpliSafe's mobile and web app controls are also very basic, and don't have almost the design or polish of a few of its competitors. They finish the job, but they will not win any awards for their eye sweet. And though SimpliSafe does support setting Nest thermostats to away modes when the alarm is set and incorporates with August locks, its smart home combinations aren't nearly as comprehensive as some of the other security systems I checked.</p>
