It likewise does well in our personal privacy and security tests. The camera includes a rolling 14 days of totally free storage for motion-trigged video clips, individual detection, voice control through Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant, and the ability to store video in your area on an SD card.

<p>We found the Circle 2 isn't quite as good as the Nest Cam for outdoor usage. It has a 10-foot power cable that limits placement, and it isn't weatherproof (you can add a weatherproof cable, however doing so makes each unit cost more than a single Nest). Also, if you don't opt to use HomeKit Secure Video you'll require to register for a $10 monthly Circle Safe subscription to have recording storage and advanced features, such as notifications that compare people and basic motion. We think that's expensive.</p>
