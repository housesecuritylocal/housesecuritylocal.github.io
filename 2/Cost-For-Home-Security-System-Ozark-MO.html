<p>In August 2019, the LockPickingLawyer YouTube channel posted a video showing how to hack into a SimpliSafe system utilizing a $2 remote. When it spotted any type of disturbance, SimpliSafe reacted with a statement stating the system would alert users. The company likewise questioned the video, declaring that there would need to be a perfect storm of situations for someone to successfully hack the system. Over a week, we ran more than 25 tests utilizing two different 433 MHz remotes, with contact sensors situated 6 to 26 feet far from the SimpliSafe Base Station, and we were not able to replicate the issue. Although our testing shouldn't be taken as definitive, we believe this issue is not likely to be a real-world issue for SimpliSafe customers who own the existing system.</p>

<p>Signals: All of the cameras we reviewed offer motion notifies, but some can notify you when they hear sound and even compare a smoke detector and a child weeping. Geographical and service restrictions use to AT&T Web services. Not all speeds offered in all locations. Call to see if you qualify. Ring also uses a variety of cameras you can buy individually.

<p>The Arlo Pro 3 is good but not great-- and so it isn't worth paying two times the price of its predecessor. When the two are compared side by side, the Arlo Pro 3 does edge out the Pro 2 on battery life and image, with 2K HDR video that is sharper throughout day and nighttime viewing. Nevertheless, color night vision image quality is disappointing, and the motion tracking function is a bit wonky. Likewise, the Pro 3 uses no complimentary storage, and external storage can't be viewed through the app, only by means of a computer system. We will keep monitoring the Arlo Pro 3, however for now, we still think the Arlo Pro 2 is a much better buy. Both are still much better than the costly Arlo Ultra, which we discovered to have terrible night-vision performance, poor battery life, and a tendency to miss out on far too many motion sets off.</p>
