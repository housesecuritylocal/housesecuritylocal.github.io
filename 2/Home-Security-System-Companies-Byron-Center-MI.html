<p>Unlike most other cameras we checked, the corded Circle 2 does not have level of sensitivity settings for motion detection (though the cordless model does ). Instead, you can filter occasion alerts just by high activity, days, or person (the latter is available just with a paid Circle Safe subscription). Without a paid Circle Safe membership, you'll get more informs, which you can just filter to receive every minute, 15 minutes, or 30 minutes.

<p>I" m not satisfied with this product. It requires an addition hard drive for storage and a cd disk to program in order to record. The photo quality is good. The motion sensors work well. I would not recommend it though. People who are tech-savvy or pressed for time might choose to install their own systems to prevent scheduling appointments and taking some time off from work. Employing a specialist costs more, but for those who choose to let an expert deal with the job and do not mind spending the additional money, professional installation is the way to go.</p>
<p>The Blink XT2 is small, works on 2 AA batteries, and includes a year's worth of complimentary cloud storage, and it catches a much better image and longer clips than its predecessors. So why isn't it a choice? It still leaves a minimum of 11 seconds in between recordings, smart device notices and live views were painfully slow, and the range is bad. Likewise, if the camera remains in the middle of recording, do not anticipate to get a live peek or make any settings modifications-- it can't multitask.</p>
