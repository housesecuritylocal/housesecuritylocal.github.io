<p>The Arlo Pro 2 is an easy-to-use outdoor Wi-Fi camera that's compact and can be used hardwired or completely wirelessly-- the latter thanks to a detachable, rechargeable battery that, based upon our screening, must offer a minimum of a couple of months of operation on a charge (depending upon usage). The Arlo Pro 2 is also the only cord-free 1080p camera on our list that offers seven days of totally free cloud storage (with more readily available for a month-to-month charge ). However, the camera will reset the sensing unit in between recordings, which Arlo states will enable the camera to appropriately find motion and not get stuck tape-recording on a loop. That also saves battery life, but it might leave you with tape-recording spaces throughout important security events. If home security is your primary issue, we 'd advise one of our top choices, but the Arlo is excellent for signing in on family and family pets-- or roaming felines sliding around your backyard.</p>
