<p>Storage capacity: For video recorders, the very first question you have to ask yourself is how much storage you will need. The answer depends upon a couple of aspects: the variety of cameras in your system, each camera's resolution, the amount of archived video footage you plan to keep and the length of time you prepare to keep taped video footage.
