<p>As an inducement to buy an alarm, a variety of companies use "complimentary monitoring services" for the first few months. Numerous insurance companies offer discounts on insurance coverage premiums to customers with operable alarm. These discounts may be as much as 20 percent for commercial clients, and slightly less for residential owners. 16 In addition, numerous police departments use a number of "totally free" incorrect alarms prior to enforcing any fine, even though the cost to react is significant right from the start. The deals of totally free monitoring services by alarm companies and discounts from insurance companies bring into question the appropriateness of the present pattern in U.S. policing of allowing three or four complimentary incorrect alarms per fiscal year, because they provide no up-front incentives to motivate owners to avoid false alarms.</p>
<p>The Arlo Pro 3 is good but not excellent-- and so it isn't worth paying two times the price of its predecessor. When the 2 are compared side by side, the Arlo Pro 3 does edge out the Pro 2 on battery life and image, with 2K HDR video that is sharper throughout day and nighttime viewing. However, color night vision image quality is frustrating, and the motion tracking feature is a bit wonky. Also, the Pro 3 provides no complimentary storage, and external storage can't be viewed through the app, just through a computer. We will keep monitoring the Arlo Pro 3, but for now, we still think the Arlo Pro 2 is a much better buy. Both are still much better than the pricey Arlo Ultra, which we found to have terrible night-vision performance, poor battery life, and a tendency to miss out on far too many motion activates.</p>

Think about that wired systems are much less vulnerable to hacking if the risk of being hacked is still a substantial concern.</p>
