<p>The Arlo Pro 3 is good but not excellent-- and so it isn't worth paying two times the price of its predecessor. When the 2 are compared side by side, the Arlo Pro 3 does edge out the Pro 2 on battery life and image, with 2K HDR video that is sharper throughout day and nighttime viewing. However, color night vision image quality is frustrating, and the motion tracking feature is a bit wonky. Also, the Pro 3 provides no complimentary storage, and external storage can't be viewed through the app, just through a computer.

Both are still much better than the pricey Arlo Ultra, which we found to have terrible night-vision performance, poor battery life, and a tendency to miss out on far too many motion activates.</p>

Think about that wired systems are much less vulnerable to hacking if the risk of being hacked is still a substantial concern.</p>
