In general, the client reviews concerning the quality of service are positive, which can sometimes be difficult to find in the home security business. Despite the fact that it's less extreme and concerns with an agreement cancelation, the majority of people report longer waiting times and limited hours of support.

However, it doesn't play also with other devices and products, like those with Z-Wave and Zigbee compatibility, and you can't automate specific commands through IFTTT (If This Then That) yet.

Burglar alarm allows need a one-time registration fee of $45. There is no annual renewal charge and the permit remains in place as long as the alarm remains in use at the same address.
