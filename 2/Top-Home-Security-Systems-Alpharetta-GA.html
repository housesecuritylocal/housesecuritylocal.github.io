<p>Honeywell's new Home system really incorporates a total Alexa speaker and wide-angle 1080p camera into the base station, however it lacks any sort of professional monitoring service. And while Abode is terrific for deep clever home tinkerers, its setup and hardware is not as easy to use as our main choices. In San Francisco, the Union Square Business Enhancement District launched an outdoor security camera program in 2012 with just 6 independently owned cameras. Now it is a surveillance network of 350 cameras, all of which share footage with the authorities.
