<p>Now let's examine why consumer-grade cameras are typically poor night vision entertainers. When a camera tries to see in the dark, it needs a source of light to light up the location listed below it. Unfortunately, the night vision illuminators that include customer cameras are created for short range only and are of a repaired brightness. This means they generally over-expose what is nearby in a scene, triggering objects and individuals to appear blown out" and with no detail. So much for attempting to recognize the bad men. Commercial cameras, however, frequently are equipped with advanced night vision infrared (IR) illuminators that can change their brightness automatically to the scene. This feature is called Smart IR", and it matches the camera's infrared light output to the scene. With Smart IR, the topics appear properly exposed and completely information.
