<p>A tight wire border security system is basically an independent screen of tensioned tripwires generally mounted on a fence or wall. Additionally, the screen can be made so thick that there is no need for a supporting chainwire fence. These systems are designed to discover any physical attempt to permeate the barrier. Taut wire systems can operate with a range of switches or detectors that pick up motion at each end of the tense wires. These switches or detectors can be an easy mechanical contact, fixed force transducer or an electronic pressure gauge. Undesirable alarms caused by birds and other animals can be prevented by changing the sensors to disregard items that exert small amounts of pressure on the wires. This kind of system is vulnerable to intruders digging under the fence. A concrete footing directly below the fence is installed to avoid this kind of attack.</p>

The 2nd generation of the WPA security procedure (WPA2) is based upon the final IEEE 802.11 i modification to the 802.11 standard and is eligible for FIPS 140-2 compliance.
