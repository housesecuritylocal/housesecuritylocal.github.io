In the London train bombings in 2005, terrorists carried bombs onto trains and buses, detonating them during rush hour.

<p>The disadvantage? It's extremely easy to devote security mistakes that will leave your home susceptible. The minute you eliminate of signal range or turn your phone to airplane mode is the minute you've left your house open. If you aren't cautious, this gaping hole in your security can prove to be a huge issue. With a monitored system, that would not be a concern.

<p>The rest of the field is more specialized, catering to sophisticated smart home connoisseurs or fans of a particular ecosytem of products. Nest's Secure has the very best style of any system I tested, including clever things like integrating the keypad and a motion detector into the base station and combining motion detectors and entry sensors into one unit. But the Secure is costly, extra sensors are costly, and the monitoring service-- which doesn't consist of emergency alarm or camera backups-- is also costly if you do not devote to a three-year contract.</p>
<p>That, along with facial acknowledgment and an integrated Google Assistant, still make the Nest IQ Outdoor cameras a top choice for outdoor security.
