Through the mobile app, you can stream live footage of your home or perhaps utilize two-way audio to interact with others. If Piper finds motion or sound, it will notify you via text, push phone, alert, or e-mail call. In fact, you can even utilize all four techniques at the exact same time.

We also experienced above-average connectivity problems, with 2 Hive test systems disconnecting 8 times over two months. Scout is extremely easy to utilize, particularly if you're a fan of mobile devices. The Scout mobile app works for iOS, Android, and web-based internet browsers, and it enables you to control nearly every aspect of the security system remotely, and it's extremely customizable.

<p>The Blink XT2 is small, works on 2 AA batteries, and consists of a year's worth of totally free cloud storage, and it captures a better image and longer clips than its predecessors. So why isn't it a pick? It still leaves a minimum of 11 seconds in between recordings, mobile phone alerts and live views were painfully sluggish, and the variety is bad.

Nest's Secure has the very best style of any system I tested, consisting of creative things like incorporating the keypad and a motion detector into the base station and integrating motion detectors and entry sensors into one unit.
