<p>A taut wire border security system is generally an independent screen of tensioned tripwires usually mounted on a fence or wall. Additionally, the screen can be made so thick that there is no need for a supporting chainwire fence. These systems are created to identify any physical attempt to penetrate the barrier. Taut wire systems can operate with a range of switches or detectors that sense movement at each end of the tense wires. These detectors or switches can be a basic mechanical contact, static force transducer or an electronic strain gauge. Unwanted alarms brought on by birds and other animals can be prevented by changing the sensors to neglect items that apply percentages of pressure on the wires. This type of system is vulnerable to burglars digging under the fence. A concrete footing directly below the fence is installed to avoid this type of attack.</p>
