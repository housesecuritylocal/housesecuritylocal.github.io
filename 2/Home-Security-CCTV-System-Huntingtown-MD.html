<h3>Monitored Home Alarm in Huntingtown MD</h3>

<p>Motion sensors offer backup protection in case a burglar handles to get into your home. However they just run when you run out the house. Do not think they'll safeguard you if someone gets in when you're sleeping! Quite the opposite, your alarm system really disregards motion sensor signals if you equip the system but stay home.
