ADT doesn't have the strongest customer service credibility amongst the companies we thought about, acquiring more than 3,000 grievances on its Bbb page While we chalked the majority of this up to the truth that ADT has numerous million more customers than its competitors, our tester began his call with low expectations.</p>
