<p>At night, though it does not have the full IR LED array of some competitors, the Arlo records enough light to see a good range, and there's an adjustable spotlight available if you're putting it outdoors - which neatly brings us to the great motion detection.

Just a couple years ago, the home security industry was controlled by a couple of huge names using costly, stiff plans with little versatility and unfriendly, long-term contracts.
