<h2>Cloud Video Monitoring & Video Surveillance For Security Cameras Delphi</h2>
<p>In a current New york city Times article about Chicago's 911 expanding digital video surveillance system, Albert Alschuler, a law professor at Northwestern University, makes the point that public camera systems do not break any personal privacy issues due to the fact that they are set up in public places. They have been carried out for public safety and criminal activity prevention and are not for the exploitation of people. A private with a camcorder, or the paparazzi, might have a more self-satisfying agenda and thanks to digital technology and the Internet can breach privacy laws with much more terrible consequences than video surveillance cameras, which are kept secured and in stringent confidence.</p>

<p>I just completed updating all of my stock annke cameras with this design. The key difference with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal change which permits you to modify the field of vision 1000% better than a camera without a horizontal change. No clue why more bullet cameras do not have this very important function. Also great metal building. Needed to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get proper mode not in black and white. Needed to make the wire hole a little bigger to fit the big selection device into the wall. Need to be a better way to implement that. But it was just a little notch so not a deal breaker. Very good resolution - much better field of view vs the stock annke cameras and better clarity during the night. Ideally these hold up over the years! Extremely suggest.</p>
