<p>Lighting: Many security cameras are able to shoot in what is referred to as "low-light infrared," allowing them to catch clear video in dark conditions. These cameras rely on infrared LED lights, which cover the dark area in infrared light. Unlike humans, the camera has the ability to see this infrared light, so when those wavelengths show back, it's as if the camera is shooting video in a brightened space. The more IR LEDs that a camera has, the much better it is able to see during the night. If capturing footage in the dark is a priority, make certain your camera has plenty of IR LEDs.</p>
