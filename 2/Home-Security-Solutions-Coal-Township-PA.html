<p>It's becoming more popular. But for the time being, if you see an outdoor camera that provides two-way audio, go all out. Others and tenants who are uncertain the length of time they will be staying in their current home should avoid entering long-lasting contracts. Nevertheless, an exception can be made for home security systems that come with benefits like the ADT Mover's Cost savings Plan, which enable you to take your equipment to a new home.
