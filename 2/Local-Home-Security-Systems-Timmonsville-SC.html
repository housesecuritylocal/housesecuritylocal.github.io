The video footage is going to eat up storage space quickly if there are lots of cameras shooting in a greater resolution. You can set a video recorder to "overwrite" the oldest footage when you reach the system's capability, but if you're not cautious, the system might overwrite archived footage that you still require.</p>

<p>The Hive View delivers great 1080p images day and night, but the motion activation triggered too quickly, even when on the lowest level of sensitivity setting. Because this camera has no native geofencing functions, you have to manually stop alerts (and recording, because it does that even when notifications are off). We also experienced above-average connectivity problems, with 2 Hive test systems detaching eight times over two months. Scout is really simple to use, particularly if you're a fan of mobile devices.

<p>We found the Circle 2 isn't rather as good as the Nest Cam for outdoor use. It has a 10-foot power cable that limits positioning, and it isn't weatherproof (you can add a weatherproof cord, but doing so makes each system cost more than a single Nest). Likewise, if you do not choose to utilize HomeKit Secure Video you'll need to sign up for a $10 month-to-month Circle Safe membership to have taping storage and advanced functions, such as alerts that compare individuals and basic motion. We believe that's costly.</p>
