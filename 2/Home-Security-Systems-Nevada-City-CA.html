<p>The only real concern we have is with the cost. The plan isn't at all cheap in the very first location, however if you wish to keep 4K recordings in the cloud you'll need a higher-tier extra subscription. Nonetheless, it's difficult to argue that the Arlo Ultra doesn't earn its price tag - it's simply that it's very much a specific niche item because of that cost, when the Arlo Pro 3 has the same smarts for less.
