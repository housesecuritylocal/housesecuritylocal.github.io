<h3>Residential Home Security Systems in Illinois</h3>
<p>When using IP cameras - as the majority of CCTV systems do these days - you will most likely be taking a look at Cat5E or Cat6 cables, which can transfer the large amount of information required by digital video and high resolutions at very fast speeds, and often over cross countries. This is an upgrade from the coax cabling that usually powers analog security cameras; coax cables are trustworthy, but not compatible with IP cameras. Oftentimes, Cat5e and Cat6 cables will also power the security cameras, eliminating the need for further circuitry. This is called Power-Over-Ethernet and requires a PoE switch when the security cameras are not connected to an NVR. Wireless security cameras might require less wiring in the walls but will still need cables to power the security camera separately, generally through 110VAC power.</p>
