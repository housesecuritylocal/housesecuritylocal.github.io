<p>The Nest Camera Outdoor's 1080p images and sound were outstanding in our testing-- throughout the day and at night-- with a broad, 130-degree field of vision and 8 x digital zoom that permitted us to get a closer view in live video. We should keep in mind that the camera would periodically downgrade the image quality based on offered bandwidth, which might vary throughout the day. Nest consists of the option to set the bandwidth to low, medium, and high, but that may defeat the function of having a 1080p camera.</p>

<p>When it comes to home security systems, Houston residents have choices. You can choose a nationally recognized brand or go with a local company. Both provide comparable offerings, but if you believe there's a chance you might leave the Houston location in the future, you may be much better off partnering with a national brand that you can take with you when you move.

(You can pump that light up to 3,000 lumens by combining the battery with outdoor cabling). It also has a number of the Arlo Pro 3's functions, consisting of 2K recording, two-way audio, and an integrated siren.
