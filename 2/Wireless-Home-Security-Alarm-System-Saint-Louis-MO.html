<p>The Arlo Pro 3 is not great but good-- therefore it isn't worth paying two times the rate of its predecessor. When the 2 are compared side by side, the Arlo Pro 3 does edge out the Pro 2 on battery life and image, with 2K HDR video that is sharper throughout day and nighttime viewing. Nevertheless, color night vision image quality is frustrating, and the motion tracking feature is a bit wonky. Also, the Pro 3 provides no complimentary storage, and external storage can't be viewed through the app, only through a computer system. We will keep monitoring the Arlo Pro 3, however for now, we still think the Arlo Pro 2 is a much better buy. Both are still better than the pricey Arlo Ultra, which we found to have dreadful night-vision efficiency, bad battery life, and a propensity to miss out on far a lot of motion activates.</p>
<p>If you do not want to spend for your Vivint equipment up front, you're taking a look at a contract varying from 42 to 60 months, which is longer than most companies that need a 36-month agreement. It's not easy to get out of it once you're in a contract. Vivint charges you 100% of the rest of your agreement if you want to cancel your service.
