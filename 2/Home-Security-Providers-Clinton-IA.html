Figure 1-1 depicts an example of a CCTV installation that keeps track of choose locations of coverage. The first installation was designed and established for the different parking facility.

<p>Had ADT, technically still have.  If you wish to leave the contract you have to pay 75% of the agreement.  So I still have 21 months of an agreement I had no idea I was in, to get out I have to pay $783.  Truly annoying. Again the sales individuals, or at least mine, do not mention the 3 year dedication. I called their customer support group and they acknowledged that the sales people do not have to mention it, it's on you to read the fine print.

<p>The NVR gets rid of these issues, due to the fact that it is instead linked directly to a network. IP cameras that are linked to the exact same network, normally by method of a PoE switch, are then able to transfer video to the NVR. Systems based around an NVR are much easier to scale up than DVR systems, merely because they can accept a new camera once it is added to the network. In the worst case, all that would be needed is an additional PoE switch. Some IP cameras are likewise wireless and can send video to the NVR over Wi-Fi. There are no distance constraints so long as a camera is connected to the exact same network as the NVR. The biggest downside to an NVR system, nevertheless, is that not every IP camera will deal with every NVR. So you'll need to know whether your cameras will work with a given video recorder prior to buying.</p>
