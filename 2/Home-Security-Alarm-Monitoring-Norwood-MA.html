<p>How secure is cloud storage? With the perceived ambiguity of the cloud, there are a number of mistaken beliefs concerning cloud storage. However contrary to popular beliefs, storing delicate information in the cloud is not always a major risk. Many VSSaaS services instantly keep the video feeds in extremely secured data centers.

Nevertheless, to conserve that battery power, recordings max out at just 10 seconds, with the system leaving a space of in between 12 seconds and 35 seconds from one clip to the next.

Let that sink in for a minute ... these companies do not even utilize the kind of cameras they are offering to the general public, and there is a good reason.</p>
