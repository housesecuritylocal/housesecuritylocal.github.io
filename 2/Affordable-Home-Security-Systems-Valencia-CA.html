<p>The Logitech Circle 2 takes adaptability up a notch. If you want to utilize it as an indoor camera, you can set it on a bookshelf or perhaps mount it on a window.

As a Honeywell Authorized Dealership of Honeywell security cameras, our business CCTV services consist of cameras, monitors, networking & cabling, closed circuit systems, video management system servers and tools, and remote management energies.</p>
<p>We discovered the Circle 2 isn't quite as good as the Nest Camera for outdoor use. It has a 10-foot power cable that limits positioning, and it isn't weatherproof (you can include a weatherproof cord, however doing so makes each unit cost more than a single Nest). Also, if you do not opt to use HomeKit Secure Video you'll need to sign up for a $10 regular monthly Circle Safe membership to have recording storage and advanced features, such as notices that compare individuals and basic motion. We think that's costly.</p>
