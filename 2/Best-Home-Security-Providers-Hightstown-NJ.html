After testing, we sent out each of our top picks, in addition to the Wyze Web cam v2, to Bill McKinley, head of info security at The New York Times (Wirecutter's parent company), for hack testing. (Expense is also a self-proclaimed paranoid infosec person.") He examined each camera for any outstanding security flaws and concluded that all of our top picks and the spending plan Wyze Web cam passed basic security standards and protections.</p>
<p>The Hive View delivers fantastic 1080p images day and night, but the motion activation set off too easily, even when on the most affordable sensitivity setting. Because this camera has no native geofencing features, you need to by hand stop notifications (and recording, given that it does that even when notices are off). We likewise experienced above-average connectivity issues, with two Hive test units disconnecting eight times over 2 months.

<p>I" m not satisfied with this product. It requires an addition hard disk for storage and a cd disk to program in order to record. The image quality is decent. The motion sensors work well. I wouldn't recommend it though. People who are tech-savvy or pushed for time might prefer to install their own systems to avoid scheduling appointments and requiring time off from work. Employing a professional costs more, but for those who prefer to let an expert manage the task and don't mind investing the money, professional installation is the method to go.</p>
