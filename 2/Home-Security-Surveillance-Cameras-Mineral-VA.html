This enables the camera or monitor to respond to different situations, such as taking a photo when your Nest Protect identifies smoke, or informing your Philips Shade wise bulb to turn on when unforeseen sounds are found.</p>
<p>I" m not satisfied with this product. It requires an addition hard disk drive for storage and a cd disk to program in order to record. The image quality is decent. The motion sensors work well.
