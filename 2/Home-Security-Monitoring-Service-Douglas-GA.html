As syndicated columnist Jacob Sullum has mentioned, "understanding that you are being seen by armed federal government representatives tends to put a damper on things.

<p>The Nest Labs Nest Cam provides higher-than-typical 1080p video resolution. Everything Vivint does, it succeeds. Where other alarm companies provide a collection of third-party equipment, Vivint styles its own stuff. Where some options, like ADT, have good equipment but so-so cameras, Vivint's cameras have some of the very best features on the marketplace, including video analytics and 4K image sensing units (in addition to more basic fare like motion detectors, two-way audio, and night vision).</p>
