<p>When SCW was established in 2010, we knew we had a job to do. Security cameras were never ever easy, and it was difficult to know what you were getting or what to do with it.

We're not happy up until we prepare every person who has SCW equipment for a life time of success. That's why, from start to finish, SCW is constantly there for you.</p>

But SimpliSafe has lower prices and more industry experience, so it's still our favorite contract-free home security system.</p>
<p>The Netatmo Welcome was rather ahead of its time as a security camera when it appeared a number of years back, and it's still a really feasible product.
