<p>The motion detection is top notch, and the app is a pleasure to utilize also (a lot better than the apps you get with some budget plan security cameras), though if you wish to get into its cleverest customisations, there is a bit of a knowing curve. For all the more basic smarts, it's fantastic, though.
