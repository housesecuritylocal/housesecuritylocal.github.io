This function is called Smart IR", and it matches the camera's infrared light output to the scene. With Smart IR, the topics appear appropriately exposed and completely detail. It has actually limited effectiveness if a camera can not catch and deliver a properly-exposed and sharp  image during the day and at night.</p>
