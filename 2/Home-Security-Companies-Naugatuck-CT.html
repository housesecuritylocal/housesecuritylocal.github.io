The crucial difference with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal adjustment which permits you to tweak the field of view 1000% much better than a camera without a horizontal adjustment.

Needed to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get proper mode not in white and black. Needed to make the wire hole a little larger to fit the substantial selection device into the wall. Should be a better method to execute that. However it was simply a little notch so not an offer breaker.
