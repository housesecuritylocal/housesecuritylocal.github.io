The first job is the alert of a siren, this enables everyone in your neighborhood including the property owners or company owner to understand that an intruder has been spotted. The 2nd task is flashing outdoor lights. Not all burglar alarms have flashing outdoor lights but the most typical alarm system and some of the more advanced ones do. The most typical kinds of burglar alarms have an automobile dialer which alerts authorities in the location to dispatch to business or the home that is being burglarized.

If they are hidden, they are a more subtle method of tape-recording the environment. D. An alarm user shall maintain at each burglar alarm website, a set of written operating instructions for each alarm. (Ord. 2002-28 § 1, 2002). The disadvantage to monitored systems is the cost.
