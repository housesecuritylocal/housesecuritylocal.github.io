When a client presses the emergency button, it sends out double notifies: one to the nurse calling station and the other to the central patient-monitoring command center, through the VMS. Additionally, if the central patient-monitoring command center received a motion detection alarm, showing that a high-risk client left her bed, the patient-monitoring operator would examine the risk and, if needed, might simply push an onscreen button to call the nursing station on that specific flooring.</p>
<p>Unlike a lot of other cameras we evaluated, the corded Circle 2 does not have sensitivity settings for motion detection (though the cordless model does ).

The subscription is more useful when utilized in high-traffic areas. Otherwise, the Smart Location feature can be set to disable recording when you're home-- to prevent informs every time you walk by. Strangely, though the app supports multiple users, its geofencing applies to each user separately, so if everybody in your household has the Circle app installed, you'll still get notifications when other individuals are home.</p>
