Expert monitoring generally carries a monthly cost on top of your equipment cost. We recommend having your home professionally monitored since of the extra layer of security that remains in place needs to you be far from home when something takes place. Without professional monitoring, you'll be responsible for monitoring your own home, generally with a mobile app and activity notices.</p>
