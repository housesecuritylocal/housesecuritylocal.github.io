<p>I just finished upgrading all of my stock annke cameras with this model. The essential difference with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal modification which allows you to modify the field of view 1000% better than a camera without a horizontal change. No clue why more bullet cameras do not have this very crucial function. Also great metal construction. Needed to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get right mode not in black and white. Needed to make the wire hole a little larger to fit the substantial selection gadget into the wall. Need to be a better method to carry out that. But it was just a little notch so not an offer breaker.
