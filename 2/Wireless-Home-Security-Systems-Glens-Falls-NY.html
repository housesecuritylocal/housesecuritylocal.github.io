<p>The cost of admission for the Deep Guard Home Security system isn't that high, even at $499, since it consists of three outdoor cameras with two-way audio. And the $50-per-month subscription cost sounds expensive, however it's not a lot when you consider that a live person is seeing a live feed whenever the cameras spot suspicious activity. That individual at Deep Guard's facility can caution a suspicious person that they're being observed, and they can call your local authorities dispatcher if they decline to leave or engage in a criminal act.

The Arlo Pro 2 is also the only cord-free 1080p camera on our list that provides 7 days of free cloud storage (with more available for a monthly cost ). However, the camera will reset the sensing unit in between recordings, which Arlo says will enable the camera to appropriately identify motion and not get stuck taping on a loop. That also saves battery life, however it might leave you with tape-recording spaces during essential security occasions. If home security is your main concern, we 'd recommend among our top choices, but the Arlo is terrific for checking in on household and animals-- or roaming cats slipping around your yard.</p>
