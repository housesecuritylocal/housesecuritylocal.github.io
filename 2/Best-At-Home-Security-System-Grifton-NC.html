<p>Good picture and I like that the cameras are white, they do not stand out excessive. Pretty simple to install.

With the long USB cord, I was able place the camera around 10 feet away from my desk intending into my hallway. The security program I utilize is "blue iris" which was able to find the camera without trouble. The IR lights in the evening have the ability to toss light a good 20 feet in a tight circle.

<p>The Blink XT2 is small, works on 2 AA batteries, and consists of a year's worth of free cloud storage, and it captures a much better image and longer clips than its predecessors. So why isn't it a pick? It still leaves a minimum of 11 seconds in between recordings, mobile phone notifications and live views were painfully sluggish, and the range is poor. Likewise, if the camera remains in the middle of recording, do not expect to get a live peek or make any settings changes-- it can't multitask.</p>
