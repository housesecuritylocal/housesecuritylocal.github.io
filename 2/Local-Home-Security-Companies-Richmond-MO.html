<p>The Arlo Pro 3 is good but not excellent-- therefore it isn't worth paying two times the price of its predecessor. When the two are compared side by side, the Arlo Pro 3 does edge out the Pro 2 on battery life and image, with 2K HDR video that is sharper during day and nighttime watching. However, color night vision image quality is disappointing, and the motion tracking function is a bit wonky. Also, the Pro 3 offers no complimentary storage, and external storage can't be seen through the app, only via a computer. We will keep monitoring the Arlo Pro 3, however for now, we still believe the Arlo Pro 2 is a better buy. Both are still better than the pricey Arlo Ultra, which we discovered to have horrible night-vision performance, poor battery life, and a propensity to miss out on far too many motion triggers.</p>
<p>Add smart-home gadgets and manage everything from your mobile device. The camera is the star of your system, and what you'll want to spend a lot of time taking a look at. Cameras vary on a variety of features including the quality of image it produces, extra functions such as night vision, and how and where the camera stores its video feed. SimpliSafe's Hearth Plan consists of all the home security basics you require, plus fire and smoke detection. This isn't the most affordable SimpliSafe bundle, but we believe the addition of smoke protection is a plus worth paying for.</p>
