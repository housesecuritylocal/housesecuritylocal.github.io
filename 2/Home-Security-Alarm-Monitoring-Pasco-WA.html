<p>SimpliSafe's mobile and web app controls are likewise extremely basic, and do not have almost the design or polish of some of its competitors. They finish the job, but they won't win any awards for their eye candy. And though SimpliSafe does support setting Nest thermostats to away modes when the alarm is set and integrates with August locks, its clever home integrations aren't nearly as substantial as a few of the other security systems I evaluated.</p>

<p>Last time I evaluated a Swann camera I described it as extremely middle of the road. Not great, not horrible, but with a really simple setup process (and trust me, that really is a killer function when it pertains to wise cameras.) This newer version is much the same, to be frank. With a digital video recorder DVR, you get clear audio and video and remote watching, plus you can tape from all cameras at the very same time. A DVR is a must in order to get the maximum efficiency no matter which of the security camera systems you choose.</p>
