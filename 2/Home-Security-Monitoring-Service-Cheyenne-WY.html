<p>Home security systems and modern smart home abilities and compatibilities enable you to use their sensors and cameras directly from your phone. For some, that might be worth the $300 cost. But while we like the smart functions and home automation compatibility of the Nest Cam IQ, a number of the cameras we looked at deal the exact same advantages at a more affordable cost. Manage your home no matter where you are with the Vivint Smart Home app. Use your smart device to see and speak with visitors at your door, see and secure packages, track activity with kept video clips, or engage with household at home.

<p>The smart device app has 3 moduses operandi-- Standby, Home, and Away. When you position the device on Standby mode, you hear a small chirping sound whenever the entry sensors get set off. In Home mode, a loud 93dB alarm is set off whenever the entry sensors are set off. Finally, in Away mode, both the motion sensing units and entry sensing units are active. These are all relatively intelligent modes, however they can not be changed. You can't change the sensitivity of the sensors or schedule them. This also leaves you vulnerable to false alarms, specifically if you have small kids or pets in your home. Some people choose the absence of customizability since it makes the whole device incredibly simple to use. However it can also be a significant hindrance for some.</p>
