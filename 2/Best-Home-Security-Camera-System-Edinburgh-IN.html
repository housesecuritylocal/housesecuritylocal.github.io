<p>We didn't think about alarm that needed professional installation. Pro-installed systems normally cost more, usage equipment comparable to that of Do It Yourself systems, included long and usually onerous agreements, and typically rely on the same monitoring companies that self-installed systems use, so they offer little advantage. A fine example is the Vivint system, which we've evaluated separately and don't recommend for most people.</p>
<p>SimpliSafe was among the very first Do It Yourself home security systems to strike shops and is an affordable alternative to ADT and other expert companies. That's due in big part to its wide range of devices. Its starter package expenses just $230 and underwent a hardware upgrade just recently that looks far better than before.

Depending on range and construction products, several wireless repeaters might be required to bring the signal to the alarm panel reliably. A wireless system can be moved to a new home quickly, a benefit for those who lease or who move often.
