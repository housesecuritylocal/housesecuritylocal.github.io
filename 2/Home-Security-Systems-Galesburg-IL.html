<p>CCTV surveillance is grounded in the criminology theory that suggests possible offenders are less likely to commit criminal offense if they believe they are being viewed or have a higher threat of being nabbed. This is also known as the rational option theory (La Vigne et al. 2011). CCTV is also grounded in situational criminal activity avoidance method, which argues that chances to anger can be reduced by altering a variety of mechanisms such as increasing the threat of a culprit being apprehended, increasing the effort to dedicate the crime, reducing rewards from criminal activity commission, and reducing provocations that give rise to criminal opportunities (La Vigne et al. 2011). This implies that the wrongdoer needs to understand the added surveillance for it to accomplish its wanted result.</p>

<p>Not all security cameras operate in the dark. Security cameras that have low-light abilities have a shutter that permits more light to get in the camera's sensing unit. The more light that is permitted to enter the camera the brighter the image will be. However, even these low light capable cameras have digital noise that make the dark image appearance fuzzy. To combat this fuzzy image some security cameras come geared up with 2D and 3D digital sound reduction Some security cameras now come with infrared light that is invisible to the human eye but can be gotten by a security camera's sensor.</p>
