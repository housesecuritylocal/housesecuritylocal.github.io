This suggests the 720 ° camera has far less resolution per square inch; it is starting with the same image sensor, 10MP in this case, though it needs to spread out that image throughout a far bigger area and therefore will not look as crisp of a camera that only has a 130 ° field of view.</p>

So why isn't it a pick? It still leaves a minimum of 11 seconds in between recordings, mobile phone notifications and live views were painfully slow, and the variety is bad. Also, if the camera is in the middle of recording, don't expect to get a live peek or make any settings modifications-- it can't multitask.</p>
