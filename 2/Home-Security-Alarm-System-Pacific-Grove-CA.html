<p>Unlike most other cameras we tested, the corded Circle 2 does not have sensitivity settings for motion detection (though the cordless model does ). Instead, you can filter occasion notifications just by high activity, days, or individual (the latter is available only with a paid Circle Safe membership). Without a paid Circle Safe membership, you'll get more signals, which you can just filter to get every minute, 15 minutes, or 30 minutes. The subscription is better when used in high-traffic locations. Otherwise, the Smart Location feature can be set to disable recording when you're home-- to prevent alerts whenever you stroll by. Strangely, though the app supports numerous users, its geofencing uses to each user individually, so if everybody in your family has the Circle app set up, you'll still get notices when other individuals are home.</p>
