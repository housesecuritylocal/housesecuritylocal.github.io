<p>During the night, though it does not have the full IR LED selection of some rivals, the Arlo records enough light to see a good range, and there's an adjustable spotlight readily available if you're putting it outdoors - which nicely brings us to the wonderful motion detection. Not only is the Arlo quick to choose moving items, it's brainy enough to make a good stab at working out precisely what it's looking at. Simply a couple decades back, the home security industry was controlled by a couple of huge names providing costly, stiff plans with little flexibility and hostile, long-term agreements. Systems were limited to a couple wired motion sensors connected to a keypad control panel and go through a landline. Nowadays, this has actually all altered.</p>
