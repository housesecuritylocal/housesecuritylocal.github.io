<p>I just finished upgrading all of my stock annke cameras with this design. The crucial difference with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal change which enables you to modify the field of vision 1000% better than a camera without a horizontal modification. No idea why more bullet cameras do not have this really crucial feature. Also good metal building and construction. Had to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get right mode not in black and white. Needed to make the wire hole a little larger to fit the big selection gadget into the wall. Should be a much better way to carry out that. But it was just a little notch so not a deal breaker. Excellent resolution - better field of view vs the stock annke cameras and far better clearness at night. Hopefully these hold up over the years! Extremely recommend.</p>
