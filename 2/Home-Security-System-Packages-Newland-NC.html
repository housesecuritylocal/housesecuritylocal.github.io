<p>The NVR removes these problems, due to the fact that it is rather linked directly to a network. IP cameras that are linked to the very same network, typically by way of a PoE switch, are then able to transmit footage to the NVR. Systems based around an NVR are much easier to scale up than DVR systems, just since they can accept a new camera once it is added to the network. In the worst case, all that would be needed is an extra PoE switch. Some IP cameras are also wireless and can send video footage to the NVR over Wi-Fi. There are no distance constraints so long as a camera is connected to the exact same network as the NVR. The largest downside to an NVR system, however, is that not every IP camera will deal with every NVR. So you'll need to understand whether your cameras will be compatible with an offered video recorder prior to buying.</p>
