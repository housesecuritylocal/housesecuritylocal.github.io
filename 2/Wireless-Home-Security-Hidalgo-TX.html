I put this wireless CCTV camera type top of the list simply since if you don't know it, you will lose big. Smart innovation knows the difference. With wise sensors, you and your pet can remain safeguarded without worry of false alarms. It is better to have a different computer system (server) for submitting video to the cloud.

<p>Recording the footage from your security cameras needs hard drives or cloud based storage.

If your dealing with recorded video storage on an IP camera system, then your network video recorder (NVR) can utilize hard disks for on-site recording and cloud-based recording in the event of disk drive malfunction.</p>
<p>I" m not satisfied with this product. It requires an addition hard disk drive for storage and a cd disk to program in order to record. The image quality is good. The motion sensors work well. I wouldn't suggest it though. People who are tech-savvy or pushed for time may choose to install their own systems to avoid scheduling visits and requiring time off from work. Calling in a technician costs more, however for those who choose to let a professional handle the job and don't mind spending the extra money, professional installation is the way to go.</p>
<p>Two-way audio allows you to be able to hear and speak with visitors (those who are both unwanted and welcome).

<p>The night vision on this camera is praised time and again in customer reviews, and it delivers a crisp image approximately 32 feet. And despite the fact that the app and software are simple to deal with, it's a bit of a disappointment that you can't integrate this camera with any clever home centers or gizmos.
