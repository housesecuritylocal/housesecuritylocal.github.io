<p>We deliver value-added security and surveillance systems and services providing convenience, comfort and fulfillment to every client and are devoted to fulfilling our client's needs with stability, sincerity, enthusiasm and excellent service. Video surveillance monitoring is as old as the extremely principle of camera surveillance. Video surveillance has come a long way, spanning numerous decades. The first video surveillance system was a Closed-Circuit Television (CCTV) installed in 1942 by German researchers to monitor the launch of rockets. The innovation gradually progressed into the highly advanced yet budget-friendly systems readily available today. The first usages of CCTV cameras needed monitoring the feed in real-time - i.e., they did not have the means to tape-record video and see it later on. Although video surveillance was monitored out of requirement in the early days, nowadays it is an intentional practice to enhance the outcome of security systems.</p>
