<h3>Best Home Security Providers in New Jersey</h3>
<p>When using IP cameras - as the majority of CCTV systems do nowadays - you will most likely be looking at Cat5E or Cat6 cables, which can move the large amount of information required by digital video and high resolutions at really quick speeds, and often over cross countries. This is an upgrade from the coax cabling that generally powers analog security cameras; coax cables are trustworthy, but not suitable with IP cameras. In most cases, Cat5e and Cat6 cables will also power the security cameras, removing the need for further electrical wiring. This is called Power-Over-Ethernet and requires a PoE switch when the security cameras are not linked to an NVR. Wireless security cameras may need less electrical wiring in the walls but will still need cable televisions to power the security camera independently, usually by means of 110VAC power.</p>
