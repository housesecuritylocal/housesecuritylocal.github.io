It also comes with two days of free cloud storage (with an option for more ), which can pack in clips of up to 3 minutes.

Protective Systems utilizes a touch-screen control panel and keypads, various sensing units (motion, glass break, smoke, carbon monoxide gas, door contacts), and surveillance cameras to monitor homes. When making a choice, they are the only company of the 4 discussed that utilizes a combination of wired and wireless technology so keep that in mind.</p>
