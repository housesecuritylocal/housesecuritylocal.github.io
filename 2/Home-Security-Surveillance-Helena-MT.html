(You can secure that plug and include another 15 feet of cable with the $30 extension set, or acquire a Window Mount or a Plug Mount) This means the Circle 2 ends up being more pricey general per system than the Nest camera if you desire a weatherproof option. Logitech does make a cordless variation of the Circle 2, though we don't suggest it considering that its battery-saving routines can disrupt efficiency.</p>
