<p>A wise lock is normally part of a robust smart home security setup, but you don't need to purchase a full-blown system to utilize one. If you're using a home automation hub to manage things like lighting and thermostats, you can include a Z-Wave or Zigbee smart lock to the system without much effort.

Some models use your existing keyed cylinder and deadbolt hardware and attach to the inside of your door, while others need that you remove your existing exterior and interior escutcheons and change the deadbolt and strike hardware.</p>
