<p>The Wi-Fi Protected Gain Access To (WPA and WPA2) security procedures were later created to resolve the problems with WEP. If a weak password, such as a dictionary word or short character string is utilized, WPA and WPA2 can be cracked. Utilizing a long enough random password (e.g. 14 random letters) or passphrase (e.g. 5 arbitrarily selected words) makes pre-shared key WPA virtually uncrackable. The 2nd generation of the WPA security protocol (WPA2) is based on the last IEEE 802.11 i modification to the 802.11 requirement and is eligible for FIPS 140-2 compliance.

<p>Some wireless home security systems provide a video recording storage alternative and others do not. For the ones that do not, you have the ability to see a live video feed of your home at any time you access your system; however, nothing is taped.

This option is usually cost-free. A cloud storage option conserves your video in the cloud. However, this is usually a paid service and the number of hours it will store will depend upon how much cloud storage you want to spend for.</p>
