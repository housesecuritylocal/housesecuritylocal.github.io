Lots of insurer use discounts on insurance coverage premiums to clients with operable alarm systems. These discounts may be as much as 20 percent for commercial customers, and somewhat less for residential owners. 16 In addition, many cops departments use numerous "complimentary" false alarms prior to enforcing any fine, even though the cost to respond is significant right from the start.
