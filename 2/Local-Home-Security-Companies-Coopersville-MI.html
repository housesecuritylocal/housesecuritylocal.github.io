<p>I just finished updating all of my stock annke cameras with this model. The key difference with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal modification which allows you to modify the field of view 1000% better than a camera without a horizontal adjustment. No clue why more bullet cameras do not have this very important feature. Likewise great metal construction. Had to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get proper mode not in white and black. Needed to make the wire hole a little bigger to fit the big selection gadget into the wall. Must be a much better method to execute that. However it was simply a little notch so not a deal breaker. Excellent resolution - better field of vision vs the stock annke cameras and much better clearness during the night. Ideally these hold up over the years! Extremely advise.</p>
