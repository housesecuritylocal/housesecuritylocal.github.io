<p>We had regularly pleasant, informative interactions with Frontpoint's customer support, and were particularly pleased about its easy DIY install After a grand overall of half an hour, we had the ability to get our control panel connected and online, location our door sensors, and trigger the system. Our tester did strike a roadblock when his control panel wouldn't link, however a service rep dealt with the issue right away and new equipment arrived the next day.</p>
<p>The night vision on this camera is praised time and again in client reviews, and it delivers a crisp image up to 32 feet. And despite the fact that the app and software are simple to work with, it's a bit of a letdown that you can't incorporate this camera with any wise home hubs or gizmos. A great deal of smart cameras can be set to do things like this, but couple of make things as easy as Hive have done within their app, and I salute them for that. Tech is supposed to make our lives much easier and Hive's environment measures up to that. It's all the function with no disappointment.</p>
