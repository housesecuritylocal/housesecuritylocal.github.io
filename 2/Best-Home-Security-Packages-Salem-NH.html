<p>Our alarm systems might be armed in the Away" or Stay" mode. Once the burglar alarms are activated, each monitored zone has the capability to recognize a violation. Once a zone has actually been violated, the intruder alarm system then dials an ADT monitoring center and transmits the message through a telephone line. When the signal is received, the intruder alarm will wait to send another message if another zone is tripped. Going into the code on the alarm system's keypad and switching off the system will end this procedure with the ADT monitoring center.</p>
<p>There's no dedicated center involved here - each camera connects directly to your router through Wi-Fi, and streams to your phone (or to the outside world) from there.

Then, the monitoring company right away sets to action, connecting with you and informing the authorities.</p>

<p>Not all security cameras operate in the dark. Security cameras that have low-light abilities have a shutter that enables more light to go into the camera's sensing unit. The more light that is permitted to get in the camera the brighter the image will be. Nevertheless, even these low light capable cameras have digital noise that make the dark image look fuzzy.
