<p>Now let's examine why consumer-grade cameras are often bad night vision performers. When a camera tries to see in the dark, it needs a light source to illuminate the location below it.

This implies they usually over-expose what is nearby in a scene, causing individuals and objects to appear burnt out" and with no detail. A lot for trying to identify the bad guys. Commercial cameras, nevertheless, frequently are geared up with advanced night vision infrared (IR) illuminators that can change their brightness immediately to the scene. This function is called Smart IR", and it matches the camera's infrared light output to the scene. With Smart IR, the topics appear effectively exposed and completely detail. If a camera can not capture and deliver a sharp and properly-exposed image throughout the day and at night, it has restricted effectiveness.</p>
