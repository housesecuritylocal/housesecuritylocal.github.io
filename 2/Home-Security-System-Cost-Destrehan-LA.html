<p>In August 2019, the LockPickingLawyer YouTube channel published a video demonstrating how to hack into a SimpliSafe system utilizing a $2 remote. When it identified any type of interference, SimpliSafe reacted with a declaration saying the system would inform users. The company also questioned the video, claiming that there would need to be a best storm of situations for someone to effectively hack the system. Over a week, we ran more than 25 tests utilizing two different 433 MHz remotes, with contact sensors located 6 to 26 feet away from the SimpliSafe Base Station, and we were unable to reproduce the issue. Although our testing should not be taken as conclusive, we believe this concern is unlikely to be a real-world issue for SimpliSafe clients who own the existing system.</p>

<p>We discovered the Circle 2 isn't rather as good as the Nest Cam for outdoor use. It has a 10-foot power cord that restricts positioning, and it isn't weatherproof (you can include a weatherproof cord, but doing so makes each unit cost more than a single Nest). Also, if you don't choose to utilize HomeKit Secure Video you'll need to sign up for a $10 monthly Circle Safe membership to have recording storage and advanced features, such as notices that distinguish between people and basic motion. We think that's costly.</p>
