Just like Vizzini's overuse of impossible" in The Princess Bride, home security companies like to toss around the word wireless" quite freely. We get it.

You can set up notifies with "Home", "Away", and "Sleep" modes in the app. Fixed-mount security cameras are non-discriminating in what they record; whatever within their focus capability is recorded.

This technology (a) has the potential modification the core experience of heading out in public in America since of its chilling result on residents, (b) carries really genuine risks of abuse and "mission creep," and (c) would not considerably secure us against terrorism.
